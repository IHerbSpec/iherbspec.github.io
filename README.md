## üåø About IHerbSpec

IHerbSpec is an international working group developing **community standards**, **tools**, and **collaborations** to advance the use of reflectance spectroscopy in herbarium-based research. Our goal is to enable high-quality, interoperable, and scalable digitization of spectral data from preserved plant specimens for use in ecology, evolution, systematics, and conservation.

The working group includes participants representing biodiversity collections  and academic institutions worldwide.
