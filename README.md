## 🌿 About IHerbSpec

IHerbSpec is an international working group developing **community standards**, **tools**, and **collaborations** to advance the use of reflectance spectroscopy in herbarium-based research. Our goal is to enable high-quality, interoperable, and scalable digitization of spectral data from preserved plant specimens for use in ecology, evolution, systematics, and conservation.

The working group includes participants representing biodiversity collections and academic institutions worldwide.

- **IHerbSpec Protocol**  
  Standardized procedures for spectral measurement and metadata documentation  
  https://iherbspec.github.io/protocol

- **Publications**

## 📘 Guide to the code and deployment of the IHerbSpec Protocol: 

The **IHerbSpec Protocol** is a community-developed standard that defines best practices for the spectral digitization of herbarium specimens, including measurement procedures, metadata requirements, and data management guidance.

### Living standard
The protocol is maintained as a **living document** on the IHerbSpec website:

🔗 https://iherbspec.github.io/protocol

This web version represents the most current state of the protocol and may include incremental updates, clarifications, or expansions developed through ongoing community collaboration.

### Versioned archival releases
At defined milestones, the protocol is **versioned and archived** as a citable release on **Zenodo** (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18451589). Each release:

- is generated directly from the source code in this repository using Quarto,
- includes a **compiled PDF** of the protocol for offline use and long-term reference (rendered at iherbspec.github.io/protocol/releases/*pdf),
- includes **snapshots of the rendered website** as html files that can be navigated via the file iherbspec.github.io/docs/index.html, and
- is assigned a version-specific DOI, while sharing a stable **concept DOI (10.5281/zenodo.18451589)** across all releases.

This model ensures both **currency** (via the living website) and **reproducibility and citability** (via archived releases).

### Customization and IHerbSpec community contributions
Herbaria and research groups may adapt the IHerbSpec Protocol for local workflows by cloning this repository and editing the Quarto source files. Customized versions can be rendered locally as institution-specific HTML websites and/or PDF documents with clear attribution to the original IHerbSpec Protocol (see license).

Members of the IHerbSpec working group are encouraged to contribute to the  development of the protocol through the **Discussions** or **Issues tools** in this GitHub repository.
