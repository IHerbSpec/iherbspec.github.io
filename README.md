## 🌿 About IHerbSpec

IHerbSpec is an international working group developing **community standards**, **tools**, and **collaborations** to advance the use of reflectance spectroscopy in herbarium-based research. Our goal is to enable high-quality, interoperable, and scalable digitization of spectral data from preserved plant specimens for use in ecology, evolution, systematics, and conservation.

The working group includes participants representing biodiversity collections and academic institutions worldwide.

## 📘 The IHerbSpec Protocol: Living Standard and Archival Releases

The **IHerbSpec Protocol** is a community-developed standard that defines best practices for the spectral digitization of herbarium specimens, including measurement procedures, metadata requirements, and data management guidance.

### Living standard
The protocol is maintained as a **living document** on the IHerbSpec website:

🔗 https://iherbspec.github.io/protocol

This web version represents the most current state of the protocol and may include incremental updates, clarifications, or expansions developed through ongoing community collaboration.

### Versioned archival releases
At defined milestones, the protocol is **versioned and archived** as a citable release on **Zenodo** (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18451589). Each release:

- is generated directly from the source code in this repository using Quarto,
- includes a **compiled PDF** of the protocol for offline use and long-term reference,
- includes a **snapshot of the rendered website**, and
- is assigned a **version-specific DOI**, while sharing a stable **concept DOI** across all releases.

This model ensures both **currency** (via the living website) and **reproducibility and citability** (via archived releases).
