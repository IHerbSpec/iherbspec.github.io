## 🌿 About IHerbSpec

IHerbSpec is an international working group developing **community standards**, **tools**, and **collaborations** to advance the use of reflectance spectroscopy in herbarium-based research. Our goal is to enable high-quality, interoperable, and scalable digitization of spectral data from preserved plant specimens for use in ecology, evolution, systematics, and conservation.

The working group includes participants from biodiversity collections, research institutions, and data infrastructures worldwide.
