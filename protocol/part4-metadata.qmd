This section defines the metadata fields used to describe spectral reflectance measurements of herbarium specimens. This standardization supports interoperability, cross-project data aggregation, and future integration into biodiversity informatics platforms.

Projects can download the **IHerbSpec Metadata Spreadsheet** (available at [https://iherbspec.github.io/protocol](../protocol.qmd#download-iherbspec-protocol-files)) as a foundation for organizing their metadata. This spreadsheet includes all **required** and optional but **recommended** fields defined the tables in [Section 4.1](#tbl-4-1). The controlled vocabularies necessary for enumerating certain fields are provided in [Section 4.2](part4-metadata.qmd#controlled-vocabularies). Finally, [Section 4.3](part4-metadata.qmd#guidelines-for-data-archiving-and-sharing) provides general guidelines for data and metadata storage and dissemination.

While metadata are expected to be disseminated in a flat file format (as in the IHerbSpec Metadata Spreadsheet), fields are presented here in logical groups—project, specimen, and tissue—to support conceptual understanding and integration with local databases.

### Table 4.2: Specimen Metadata {#tbl-4-2}

Specimen metadata include identifiers and information about the physical specimen, with priority given to **required** fields needed to link spectral measurements to existing digital records (e.g., `specimenId`). Optional fields related to taxonomic determination and specimen storage environment are included to support integrative research, quality control, and downstream analysis. 

Users should **avoid duplicating metadata that are already digitized, maintained, and available in herbarium or institutional platforms**, as these sources are better suited for future updates. Instead, users are encouraged to reference those records and supplement only missing required or recommended fields. Due to variation in the metadata recorded on institutional platforms, users should apply caution in the interpretation of presence or absence of determination information or any other recommended but optional fields.

| `hasLowReflectanceBackground` | - | Required | True or False statement that the background (black or paper) has low reflectance as defined as less than 4% reflectance across the spectral range of the instrument. For a paper background, this would be scored `false`.       | BOOLEAN |
| `backgroundDescription`       | - | Cond. Req. | Description of the black or other background material, including manufacturer and product information when available. Not required for paper backgrounds. Required field when tissue has black or other type (not paper) of background.<br>Example: `Musou IR Flock`  | TEXT |

### Table 4.6: Tissue Descriptor Codes {#tbl-4-6}

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `GoodPreservation` | Tissue in the measurement area appears well preserved in color, structure, and texture (including original features from disease or herbivory) and shows minimal signs of degradation or breakage from pressing, drying, or storage. Tissues that are simply discolored may still be considered well preserved if other aspects of integrity are maintained. |
| `MediumPreservation` | Tissue in the measurement area shows moderate degradation, such as partial discoloration, wilting, or deformation. Some structural loss may be present, though not severe. Evidence of degradation from other parts of the specimen (e.g., mold elsewhere on the tissue) may support assigning this level of preservation, but such observations should be recorded in tissueNotes if not present within the measurement area. This is expected to be the most common preservation condition for herbarium specimens used in spectral measurement. |
| `PoorPreservation` | Tissue in the measurement area shows clear signs of degradation, including severe discoloration, wrinkling, deformation, or breakage. Mold, insect damage, or other signs of poor preservation may also be present. As with other flags, evidence of degradation outside the measurement area (e.g., mold elsewhere on the tissue) may support the assigned flag but should be recorded in tissueNotes if not directly observed in the measurement area. Note that natural discoloration tendencies of certain taxa should be considered when applying this flag (see Appendix II). |
| `MidveinPresent` | Target measurement area contains midvein or similarly prominent secondary venation. |
| `OrganismPresent` | Indicates that a visible organism (e.g., bryophyte, lichen, fungal structure) is present on or within the measurement area. This includes epiphyllous, endophytic, or other leaf-associated organisms, regardless of their ecological role (e.g., mutualistic, parasitic, or incidental). This flag serves as a general indicator and can be used in conjunction with more specific organism flags below. |
| `BryophytePresent` | Indicates that a visible bryophyte (e.g., moss, liverwort, or hornwort) is present on or within the measurement area. |
| `LichenPresent` | Indicates that a visible lichen thallus or fragment is present on or within the measurement area. |
| `FungusPresent` | Indicates that fungal structures are visible in the measurement area (e.g., hyphae, mycelium, fruiting body) and are presumed to be pre-mortem associates, such as endophytes or pathogens active while the plant was alive. This flag can overlap with PathogenPresent or MoldPresent. |
| `PathogenPresent` | Target measurement area contains necrotic tissue or other signs of pathogenic infection. Can be used with FungusPresent when fungal pathogens are suspected or known. This flag is based on visible tissue symptoms, not molecular confirmation. |
| `MoldPresent` | Indicates that the measurement area shows signs of post-mortem fungal growth (e.g., surface mold, fuzz, bloom), likely resulting from poor drying or storage conditions. In practice, mold may be difficult to distinguish from other fungal growth without microscopic or culture analysis. Use judgment and note uncertainty in tissueNotes if needed. |
| `HerbivoryPresent` | Target measurement area contains herbivory. |
| `AlcoholPresent` | Target measurement area was preserved with ethanol or other alcohol. |
| `PreservativePresent` | Target measurement area contains chemical preservative contamination excluding alcohol preservatives (e.g., diatoms, formaldehyde). |
| `BurnPresent` | Target measurement area contains burned tissue. |
| `DebrisPresent` | Target measurement area contains non-specific material not described in other codes (e.g., dust, soil particles, insect parts, fibers, etc.) that may interfere with clean measurements. Can be elaborated in the tissueNotes field. |

### Table 4.7: Background and White Reference Class Codes {#tbl-4-7}

Available codes for enumerating the required `tissueBackgroundClass` metadata [Table 4.3](#tbl-4-3). Either the abbreviated code or the full CamelCase with initial capital letter jformatted code may be used.

| Code | Full code | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `W`    | `WhiteReference` | White reference. |
| `B`    | `BlackBackground` | Black background (<4% reflectance). |
| `P`    | `PaperBackground` | Herbarium sheet paper. |
| `O`    | `OtherBackground` | Other background material (must be described in metadata). |

# 4.3 Guidelines for Data Archiving and Sharing

- For each specimen, a copy of **all unprocessed spectral files and metadata should be archived** in the digital repository of the herbarium or institution that owns the specimen, or otherwise in accordance with their data storage practices. This ensures that the data remain co-located with the physical specimen and integrated with institutional capabilities for managing specimen metadata.
  
- In addition, projects should **upload unprocessed, original format data files and metadata to a persistent, open-access repository** that issues DOIs and supports versioning, such as Dryad, Zenodo, or Harvard Dataverse. These platforms are preferred over tools like EcoSIS, which have shown reduced reliability and uncertain long-term support.
  
- To facilitate reuse, users may also choose to also share tabular data files (e.g., .csv) with samples in rows and columns for metadata fields and spectral band values. If processed spectra are included (e.g., interpolated, splice/jump-corrected, or continuum- removed), the applied processing steps should be clearly documented.
  
- See<br>Example of data and metadata sharing here: [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LXPHBC](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LXPHBC)
