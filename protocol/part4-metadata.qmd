## Overview {#part4}

This section defines the metadata fields used to describe spectral reflectance measurements of herbarium specimens. This standardization supports interoperability, cross-project data aggregation, and future integration into biodiversity informatics platforms.

| Section | Section Title | Description |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| [4.1](part4-metadata.qmd#section4-1) | Metadata Tables | Defines the core metadata tables used in the IHerbSpec Protocol, including session ([Table 4.1](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-1)), specimen ([Table 4.2](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-2)), and tissue ([Table 4.3](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-3)) metadata. |
| [4.2](part4-metadata.qmd#section4-2) | Controlled Vocabularies | Defines the controlled vocabularies to be applied in metadata fields. Includes Developmental Stage Class Codes ([Table 4.4](#tbl-4-4)), Target Class Codes ([Table 4.5](#tbl-4-5)), Tissue Descriptor Codes ([Table 4.6](#tbl-4-6)), and Background and White Reference Class Codes ([Table 4.7](#tbl-4-7)) |
| [4.3](part4-metadata.qmd#section4-3) | Guidelines for Data Archiving and Sharing | Guidance on archiving, sharing, and publishing spectral data and metadata, including recommended repositories, formats, and interoperability considerations. |


Projects can download the [IHerbSpec Metadata Spreadsheet](tables/IHerbSpec_metadata.csv) as a foundation for organizing their metadata. This spreadsheet includes all **required** and optional but **recommended** fields defined in the tables below. 

While metadata are expected to be disseminated in a flat file format (as in the IHerbSpec Metadata Spreadsheet), fields are presented here in logical groups—project, specimen, and tissue—to support conceptual understanding and integration with local databases.

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
Tables in Part 4 can be downloaded from [iherbspec.github.io/protocol](https://iherbspec.github.io/protocol).

## 4.1 Metadata Tables {#section4-1}

The three tables below describe the session, specimen, and tissue metadata fields. The “Filename Code” column (e.g., `PI`, `SN`, `SI`, `TC`) indicates the prefix used in filenames for reference (see [Part 3](part3-filenames.qmd)). 

When entering metadata values, the filename code *should not* be prepended to the value (e.g., HUHERYspec1, not PIHUHERYspec1).

### Table 4.1: Session Metadata {#tbl-4-1}

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
**Download** [Table4.1.csv](tables/Table4.1-sessionMetadata.csv) 
:::

Session metadata describe the digitization environment and can generally be captured once per project and automatically populated for each measurement instance.

| Metadata Field | Filename Code ([Table 3.2](part3-filenames.qmd#tbl-3-2)) |  Status | Field Description | Data Type |

### Table 4.2: Specimen Metadata {#tbl-4-2}

Specimen metadata include identifiers and information about the physical specimen, with priority given to **required** fields needed to link spectral measurements to existing digital records (e.g., `specimenId`). Optional fields related to taxonomic determination and specimen storage environment are included to support integrative research, quality control, and downstream analysis. 

Users should **avoid duplicating metadata that are already digitized, maintained, and available in herbarium or institutional platforms**, as these sources are better suited for future updates. Instead, users are encouraged to reference those records and supplement only missing required or recommended fields. Due to variation in the metadata recorded on institutional platforms, users should apply caution in the interpretation of presence or absence of determination information or any other recommended but optional fields.

Both abbreviated codes and descriptive codes are accepted.<br> Examples: `BGW`, `BGB`, `BGP` | ENUM<br> ([Table 4.7](#tbl-4-7)) |
| `hasLowReflectanceBackground` | - | Required | True or False statement that the background (black or paper) has low reflectance as defined as less than 4% reflectance across the spectral range of the instrument. For a paper background, this would be scored `false`       | BOOLEAN |
| `backgroundDescription`       | - | Cond. Req. | Description of the black or other background material, including manufacturer and product information when available. Not required for paper backgrounds. Required field when tissue has black or other type (not paper) of background.<br> Example: `Musou IR Flock`  | TEXT |
| `targetClass`                 | `TC` | Required | Free text or enumerated code from Target Class Codes ([Table 4.5](#tbl-4-5)) describing type of tissue or background being measured.

### Table 4.6: Tissue Descriptor Codes {#tbl-4-6}

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
**Download** [Table4.6.csv](tables/Table4.6-TissueDescriptorCodes.csv) 
:::

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `GoodPreservation` | Tissue in the measurement area appears well preserved in color, structure, and texture (including original features from disease or herbivory) and shows minimal signs of degradation or breakage from pressing, drying, or storage. Tissues that are simply discolored may still be considered well preserved if other aspects of integrity are maintained. |
| `MediumPreservation` | Tissue in the measurement area shows moderate degradation, such as partial discoloration, wilting, or deformation. Some structural loss may be present, though not severe. Evidence of degradation from other parts of the specimen (e.g., mold elsewhere on the tissue) may support assigning this level of preservation, but such observations should be recorded in tissueNotes if not present within the measurement area. This is expected to be the most common preservation condition for herbarium specimens used in spectral measurement. |
| `PoorPreservation` | Tissue in the measurement area shows clear signs of degradation, including severe discoloration, wrinkling, deformation, or breakage. Mold, insect damage, or other signs of poor preservation may also be present. As with other flags, evidence of degradation outside the measurement area (e.g., mold elsewhere on the tissue) may support the assigned flag but should be recorded in tissueNotes if not directly observed in the measurement area. Note that natural discoloration tendencies of certain taxa should be considered when applying this flag (see Appendix II). |
| `MidveinPresent` | Target measurement area contains midvein or similarly prominent secondary venation. |
| `OrganismPresent` | Indicates that a visible organism (e.g., bryophyte, lichen, fungal structure) is present on or within the measurement area. This includes epiphyllous, endophytic, or other leaf-associated organisms, regardless of their ecological role (e.g., mutualistic, parasitic, or incidental). This flag serves as a general indicator and can be used in conjunction with more specific organism flags below. |
| `BryophytePresent` | Indicates that a visible bryophyte (e.g., moss, liverwort, or hornwort) is present on or within the measurement area. |
| `LichenPresent` | Indicates that a visible lichen thallus or fragment is present on or within the measurement area. |
| `FungusPresent` | Indicates that fungal structures are visible in the measurement area (e.g., hyphae, mycelium, fruiting body) and are presumed to be pre-mortem associates, such as endophytes or pathogens active while the plant was alive. This flag can overlap with PathogenPresent or MoldPresent. |
| `PathogenPresent` | Target measurement area contains necrotic tissue or other signs of pathogenic infection. Can be used with FungusPresent when fungal pathogens are suspected or known. This flag is based on visible tissue symptoms, not molecular confirmation. |
| `MoldPresent` | Indicates that the measurement area shows signs of post-mortem fungal growth (e.g., surface mold, fuzz, bloom), likely resulting from poor drying or storage conditions. In practice, mold may be difficult to distinguish from other fungal growth without microscopic or culture analysis. Use judgment and note uncertainty in tissueNotes if needed. |
| `HerbivoryPresent` | Target measurement area contains herbivory. |
| `AlcoholPresent` | Target measurement area was preserved with ethanol or other alcohol. |
| `PreservativePresent` | Target measurement area contains chemical preservative contamination excluding alcohol preservatives (e.g., diatoms, formaldehyde). |
| `BurnPresent` | Target measurement area contains burned tissue. |
| `DebrisPresent` | Target measurement area contains non-specific material not described in other codes (e.g., dust, soil particles, insect parts, fibers, etc.) that may interfere with clean measurements. Can be elaborated in the tissueNotes field. |


### Table 4.7: Background and White Reference Class Codes {#tbl-4-7}

Available codes for enumerating the required `tissueBackgroundClass` metadata [Table 4.3](#tbl-4-3). Either the abbreviated code or the full CamelCase with initial capital letter jformatted code may be used.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
**Download** [Table4.7.csv](tables/Table4.7-BackgroundandWhiteRefClassCodes.csv) 
:::

| Code | Full code | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `W`    | `WhiteReference` | White reference. |
| `B`    | `BlackBackground` | Black background (<4% reflectance). |
| `P`    | `PaperBackground` | Herbarium sheet paper. |
| `O`    | `OtherBackground` | Other background material (must be described in metadata). |


## 4.3 Guidelines for Data Archiving and Sharing {#section4-3}

- For each specimen, a copy of **all unprocessed spectral files and associated metadata should be archived** by the herbarium or institution that owns the specimen, or otherwise managed in accordance with institutional data storage practices. Wherever possible, these data should remain **co-located with specimen records** or stored in infrastructure (e.g., institutional servers, cloud services, or collection management systems) that supports long-term stewardship, identifier stability, and integration with specimen metadata.

- In addition to institutional archiving, projects are strongly encouraged to **deposit unprocessed spectral data files and metadata in a persistent, open-access repository** that issues DOIs and supports versioning.  
  The **IHerbSpec Dataverse** (<https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/iherbspec/>) is a community-curated, thematic repository designed specifically to serve herbarium spectral data and metadata. It provides free access, dataset-level versioning, rich metadata support, and curation aligned with the IHerbSpec Protocol. Datasets deposited in the IHerbSpec Dataverse can be linked to specimen records in primary digitization platforms (e.g., Symbiota, Specify, Tropicos) using stable identifiers and resource relationships, enabling integration across systems while allowing spectral data to be managed in infrastructure optimized for these data types.

- The IHerbSpec Dataverse supports a **project-based data sharing model**, suitable for laboratory studies, collaborative research projects, and digitization efforts that span multiple collections. Datasets may include raw spectra, metadata spreadsheets, README documentation, processed spectra, and associated trait data. Metadata are reviewed prior to release to promote compliance with the IHerbSpec Protocol and to facilitate interoperability and reuse.

- To enhance discoverability and specimen-level integration, datasets archived in external repositories (including the IHerbSpec Dataverse) may be linked to specimen records using standardized assogciations (e.g., Darwin Core Resource Relationship terms such as `isReferencedBy`). These links can be prepared in bulk and ingested by specimen portals, allowing users to search for specimens associated with spectral data while the files themselves remain hosted in the most appropriate repository.

- To facilitate reuse and analysis, projects may also share **tabular data files** (e.g., `.csv`) containing samples in rows and spectral bands and metadata fields in columns. If processed spectra are included (e.g., interpolated, splice-corrected), all applied processing steps should be clearly documented.

- When projects include **additional trait data** alongside spectral measurements, contributors should ensure that trait definitions, units, and measurement methods are clearly documented and standardized where possible. Ongoing community efforts will be required to align spectral data with broader trait data standards and repositories.

- Contributors should consider data governance needs, including **sensitive specimen information, traditional knowledge considerations, access restrictions, and long-term curation responsibilities**. The IHerbSpec community is actively developing governance, curation, and review practices to support responsible data sharing consistent with FAIR and CARE principles.

- The IHerbSpec community is also working toward the development of **software tools to automatically validate metadata, filenames, and dataset structure** against the IHerbSpec Protocol during data submission, and to enable future parsing of bulk datasets into specimen-specific subsets for downstream integration and reuse.

- See an example of spectral data and metadata sharing here:
