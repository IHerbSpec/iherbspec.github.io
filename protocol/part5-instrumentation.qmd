## 5.1 Precautions {#part5}

5.1.1. **Carefully handle backgrounds and white references (e.g., Spectralon®):**  

   - Use laboratory gloves to handle black backgrounds and white references and tweezers to handle herbarium tissues.  
   - Avoid touching and dirtying the reflective surfaces.  
   - Avoid blowing or cleaning backgrounds and reference standards with canned air, which can cause chemical contamination (other options, such as O2 Hurricane, avoid this contamination).  

5.1.2. **Avoid burning target tissues:**  

   - High light intensities in optical probes can burn tissues, especially thin leaves! Use low light intensity and minimum measurement duration based on manufacturer’s guidance to avoid this.  
   - Avoid measuring tissues with glue on them, whenever possible.  
   - Place a black background under the leaf or target tissue to avoid spectral contamination from the herbarium mounting paper whenever possible. Background surfaces, except for non-reflective black, will influence reflectance spectra (see [Fig. 1.1](part1-overview.qmd#f1-1)).  


## 5.2 Spectra Data Files

5.2.1. **Output unprocessed percent reflectance data to files, if possible.** 
 
   - Percent reflectance should be present in the file at the wavelengths directly measured by the instrument.  
   - If instruments and software output transformed data by default (e.g., Spectral Evolution PSR+ output is interpolated at 1 nm resolution), refer to user manuals to change settings to output percent reflectance values at measured wavelengths instead.  

5.2.2. **File formats differ among spectroradiometer manufacturers, models, and softwares.**  

   - Make sure that files include percent reflectance values.  


## 5.3 Instrumentation and Materials Quality Control

5.3.1. **Instrument maintenance:**  

   - Follow manufacturer SOP for spectroradiometer maintenance. If possible, send the instrument to the manufacturer at regular intervals for maintenance (e.g., every two years).  
   - Have fiber optic cables checked by the manufacturer annually and replace damaged fiber optic cables. You can test the integrity of the cables by shining a flashlight through one end of the fiberoptic and observing the light transmitted out the other side.

5.3.2. **For background and white reference measurement requirements, see [Section 1.2.2](part1-overview.qmd#white-reference-and-background-measurements).**  

   - Background materials are not spectrally neutral and exhibit distinct reflectance profiles that can introduce systematic, wavelength-dependent biases into leaf spectral measurements ([Fig. 5.1](images/Fig-backgrounds_v2.jpg)). These effects are especially pronounced in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared regions, underscoring the importance of consistent background selection and documentation for reproducible and comparable spectral data.
   - White reference scans are typically not saved as a separate file, but the white reference digital numbers (raw sensor values) should be included in each target spectrum file (e.g., `.sig` format). These values are used by the instrument software to calculate reflectance from raw radiance.  
   - Black background materials are required to have <4% reflectance across all wavelengths (see [Fig. 1.1](part1-overview.qmd#f1-1); e.g., IR Flock Sheet from [Musou Black USA](https://musoublackusa.com/products/ir-flock-sheet)).  
   - If measuring leaves on herbarium paper on a benchtop, place a black mat under the herbarium sheets to prevent contaminating reflectance from the benchtop (see [Fig. 4.2](part4-metadata.qmd#f4-2)). Black felt (3–5 mm thick) is a practical and cost-effective choice for this purpose.  

![**Fig. 5.1.** Reflectance of different background materials and their effects on target tissue spectra. **(A)** Reflectance spectra of common background materials used in herbarium spectral measurements, including black (Musou IR Flock), dark grey, light grey (grey matte paint on canvas), white (Spectralon 99%), and three herbarium mounting paper types of different ages. Each background exhibits a distinct spectral profile across the visible–shortwave infrared range (400—2500 nm). **(B)** Differences between adaxial leaf spectra measured on black background (TCAD_BGB) with spectra of the same leaf surface measured on the other backgrounds (see legend). Deviations from zero indicate wavelength-dependent background-induced biases, which are greatest in the near-infrared (NIR; c. 700—1100 nm) and shortwave infrared I regions (SWIR 1; 1100—2000 nm). **(C)** Reflectance spectra of leaf abaxial surface (TCAB) measured on different backgrounds, illustrating how background reflectance can influence absolute reflectance values across spectral regions. **(D)** Mean reflectance spectra of leaf adaxial surface (TCAD) measured on different backgrounds, showing similar background-dependent effects.  All measurements were made with a Spectral Evolution NaturaSpec spectroradiometer using a handheld herbarium leaf probe.](images/Fig-backgrounds_v2.jpg){#f5-1 fig-align="center" .fig-bordered}


5.3.3. **Target measurements of background material (black or paper) must be linked to tissue measurements using filename conventions ([Part 3](part3-filenames.qmd)).**  

   - This supports quality control of background conditions and enables development of spectral unmixing approaches to isolate tissue reflectance.  

5.3.4. **Wear gloves and carefully handle all tissues, white reference, black backgrounds, and calibrated reflectance standards to keep them clean (see [5.1 Precautions](#precautions)).**  

5.3.5. **Calibrated reflectance standards:**  

   - Institutions should consider purchasing calibrated reflectance standards, such as Spectralon® Calibrated (SL Standard) Diffuse Reflectance Standards. These should be kept clean and separate from ‘working’ white references, and used for long-term assessment of instrument performance, optical drift, and the condition of reference materials (e.g., white references and black backgrounds).  
   - These are supplied with a calibration certificate and serial number that verifies reflectance values across wavelengths.  
   - Reflectance standards are white (e.g., Spectralon® 99%) and black (e.g., Spectralon® 2%) at a minimum, and can also include gradations of gray.  
   - It is recommended that standards be measured at regular intervals depending on the level of activity (e.g., once per session; consult spectroradiometer manufacturer), and archived with the filename conventions provided in [Table 3.1](part3-filenames.qmd#tbl-3-1).  

## 5.4 Specimen and Tissue Annotation

5.4.1. **Metadata recommendation:**  

   - IHerbSpec recommends recording the `tissueLocation` metadata field (see [Table 4.3](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-3)) to document the position of measured tissues on the specimen.  

5.4.2. **Consult with herbarium collections managers** to define a suitable specimen annotation protocol that aligns with institutional policies.  

5.4.3. **Recommended specimen annotation practices:**  

   - Attach a project annotation label to the herbarium sheet (e.g., "Leaf spectral reflectance; DM White (2025)").  
   - Use archival-quality materials for labels and annotations, such as acid-free paper.  
   - Use pencil for direct annotation of measured tissues on sheets.  
   - For loose tissues (from packets or envelopes):  
     1. Place the measured tissue in a glassine envelope, which is archival and thin.  
     2. Include a label inside the envelope indicating the `targetTissueClass` and `targetTissueId` (see [Table 4.3](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-3); e.g., “Tissue TN1”).  
     3. Store the envelope in the specimen packet or attach it to the herbarium sheet (see [Fig. 4.2](part4-metadata.qmd#f4-2)).
