Field Name,Status,Field Description,Data Type
herbariumCode,Required,"The standardized acronym identifying the herbarium or collection where the specimen is deposited. This should correspond, whenever possible, to the Index Herbariorum code (https://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/), which is typically implemented as the institution code in GRSciColl. If referring to a collection within an institution code, collection identifiers may be appended using a dash “-”. Examples: ‘GH’, ‘P’, ‘US-Botany’",TEXT
specimenId,Required,"An identifier for the physical specimen or its digital record within the collection, such as a catalogue or accession number, barcode, or GUID. If no such number exists, enter the first collector name and number with no spaces between characters (for use as filename). Examples: '00238762', ‘Thorne24070a’",TEXT
scientificName,Optional,"The full scientific name of the specimen at the lowest taxonomic rank that can be confidently assigned (e.g., family, genus, species, subspecies, or variety), with or without author citation. It should not include qualifiers such as cf. or aff., which should instead be recorded in the identificationQualifier field. Hybrid taxa should be indicated using the multiplication sign (_). If no taxonomic identification is available, the field should be left blank. Scientific names should conform to a recognized botanical authority or taxonomic reference to ensure consistency across datasets (see https://worldfloraonline.org/). Examples: 'Quercus bicolor', 'Erythroxylum coca ipadu', 'Agrostis stolonifera L.', 'Agavaceae'.",TEXT
identificationQualifier,Optional,"A brief phrase or standard term indicating proximity or uncertainty of the taxonomic identification recorded in the scientificName field, following the Darwin core standard. If no qualifier is applicable, this field may be left blank. Examples: 'cf.', 'confer', 'aff.', 'affinis', 'sp.'",TEXT
identifiedBy,Optional,"The person, group, or organization that assigned the taxonomic information in the scientificName field. If no determination author is present, this field may be left blank. Example: T. Plowman",TEXT
dateIdentified,Optional,"The date on which the current taxonomic identification of the specimen was made . If no determination date is present, this field may be left blank. Examples: '1999', '2004-12-30', '2010-06-09'",TEXT
isTempControlled,Optional,Room where the specimen is stored at home institution has active heating and air conditioning installations to maintain set temperatures.,BOOLEAN
,,,(true/false)
annualTempMin,Optional,"The estimated minimum temperature in degrees celsius (ºC) experienced in the specimen’s storage environment over a typical year. Examples: '18', '18ºC'",TEXT
annualTempMax,Optional,"The estimated maximum temperature in degrees celsius (ºC) experienced in the specimen’s storage environment over a typical year. Examples: '26', '32ºC'",TEXT
isHumidityControlled,Optional,Room where the specimen is stored at home institution has active humidity conditioning installations to maintain set humidity.,BOOLEAN
,,,(true/false)
annualHumidityMin,Optional,"The estimated minimum relative humidity (%) experienced in the specimen’s storage environment in a typical year. Examples: '20', '50%'",TEXT
annualHumidityMax,Optional,"The estimated maximum relative humidity (%) experienced in the specimen’s storage environment in a typical year. Examples: '60', '100%'",TEXT
