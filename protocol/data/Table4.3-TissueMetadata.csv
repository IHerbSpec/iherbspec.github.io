Field Name,Status,Field Description,Data type
backgroundClass,Required,"Enumerated abbreviated code from Background Class Codes Table 4.7 describing the type of background used behind target tissue. Both abbreviated codes and descriptive codes are accepted. Examples: “BGW’, 'BGB', ‘BGP’",ENUM (Table 4.7: Background Class Codes)
hasLowReflectanceBackground,Required,"True or False statement that the background (black or paper) has low reflectance as defined as less than 4% reflectance across the spectral range of the instrument. For a paper background, this would be scored ‘false’.",BOOLEAN (true/false)
backgroundDescription,Conditional Required,"Description of the black or other background material, including manufacturer and product information when available. Not required for paper backgrounds. Required field when tissue has black or other type (not paper) of background. Example: Musou IR Flock",TEXT
targetClass,Required,"Free text or enumerated code from Target Class Codes (Table 4.5) describing type of tissue or background being measured. Both abbreviated codes and full codes can be used. Examples: 'AD', ‘perigynium’",TEXT or ENUM (Table 4.5: Target Class Codes)
targetTissueId,Optional,"Character index tracking the measured tissue units when multiple tissues are measured from a single specimen (e.g., 'loose1', '1', '2'). For compound or more complex structures, projects are encouraged to develop their own consistent naming convention. Examples: 'pinna1', 'leaflet1', 'petal1' ",TEXT
tissueDevelopmentalStage,Required,"Tissue developmental stage as coded in Developmental Stage Class Codes (Table 4.4). Examples: 'Mature', 'Uncertain', 'NotScored'",ENUM (Table 4.4: Developmental Stage Class Codes)
hasBackgroundInMeasurement,Required,True or false values indicating that the target tissue does not cover the full measurement area and the background is part of the measurement.,BOOLEAN (true/false)
percentBackgroundInMeasurement,Optional,Numeric estimate for the percentage of the measurement area that is not covered by the target tissue and is background material (black background or herbarium paper). It is recommended to describe the estimation method in the comment field. Example: 25,INTEGER
hasGlue,Required,"True, false, or uncertain values indicating glue is present in the measurement area.",ENUM (true/false/uncertain)
hasNonGlueContamination,Required,"True, false, or uncertain values indicating a contaminant other than glue is present in the measurement area. This includes foreign biotic or abiotic agents on the target tissue, such as fungus or preservatives.",ENUM (true/false/uncertain)
measurementFlags,Optional,Standardized categorical descriptors of the condition of the tissue within the measurement area. Values are selected from the predefined Tissue Descriptor Codes (Table 4.6). Multiple descriptors should be separated with a pipe character. Example: ‘GoodPreservation|PathogenPresent’,ENUM (Table 4.6: Tissue Descriptor Codes)
tissueNotes,Optional,"Free-text field used to record additional observations on the condition of the specimen that may aid interpretation of spectral data. It can be used to clarify or elaborate on descriptors already included in measurementFlags, such as the conditions evidencing the quality of preservation (e.g., a MediumPreservation flag could be explained with the note, 'measurement area discolored and wrinkled'). Notes should specify whether the information applies to the measurement area, the tissue unit, or the specimen as a whole. Examples: 'mold in measurement area, herbivory on leaf, specimen discolored and burnt', 'formaldehyde preserved specimen', ‘very degraded specimen’.",TEXT
tissueLocation,Optional,"The location of the target tissue on the herbarium sheet. For mounted tissues, record as an 'X,Y' coordinate in centimeters, with '0,0' at the top-left corner of the sheet (e.g., '17,29'; see Fig. 4.2). If the sheet has non-square angles, align it flush with the left-side ruler. For unmounted tissues, provide a descriptive note indicating location. Examples: 'envelope TCAD_TN1', ‘17,29’","TEXT. Coordinates preferred in the form of an integer tuple: 'X,Y'."
comment,Optional,"Free-text field for recording any additional notes relevant to the measurement, including observations about the instrument, session, specimen, tissue, or data quality that are not captured elsewhere in the metadata. Example: ‘Amazing specimen.’",TEXT
measurementIndex,Required,"The measurement number index appended to the base filename (Part 3, Table 3.2: IDX) to properly associate each row of metadata with its single, corresponding measurement file. Example: 0001",TEXT
