Code,Description
GoodPreservation,"Tissue in the measurement area appears well preserved in color, structure, and texture (including original features from disease or herbivory) and shows minimal signs of degradation or breakage from pressing, drying, or storage. Tissues that are simply discolored may still be considered well preserved if other aspects of integrity are maintained."
MediumPreservation,"Tissue in the measurement area shows moderate degradation, such as partial discoloration, wilting, or deformation. Some structural loss may be present, though not severe. Evidence of degradation from other parts of the specimen (e.g., mold elsewhere on the tissue) may support assigning this level of preservation, but such observations should be recorded in tissueNotes if not present within the measurement area. This is expected to be the most common preservation condition for herbarium specimens used in spectral measurement."
PoorPreservation,"Tissue in the measurement area shows clear signs of degradation, including severe discoloration, wrinkling, deformation, or breakage. Mold, insect damage, or other signs of poor preservation may also be present. As with other flags, evidence of degradation outside the measurement area (e.g., mold elsewhere on the tissue) may support the assigned flag but should be recorded in tissueNotes if not directly observed in the measurement area. Note that natural discoloration tendencies of certain taxa should be considered when applying this flag (see Appendix II)."
MidveinPresent,Target measurement area contains midvein or similarly prominent secondary venation.
OrganismPresent,"Indicates that a visible organism (e.g., bryophyte, lichen, fungal structure) is present on or within the measurement area. This includes epiphyllous, endophytic, or other leaf-associated organisms, regardless of their ecological role (e.g., mutualistic, parasitic, or incidental). This flag serves as a general indicator and can be used in conjunction with more specific organism flags below."
BryophytePresent,"Indicates that a visible bryophyte (e.g., moss, liverwort, or hornwort) is present on or within the measurement area."
LichenPresent,Indicates that a visible lichen thallus or fragment is present on or within the measurement area.
FungusPresent,"Indicates that fungal structures are visible in the measurement area (e.g., hyphae, mycelium, fruiting body) and are presumed to be pre-mortem associates, such as endophytes or pathogens active while the plant was alive. This flag can overlap with PathogenPresent or MoldPresent."
PathogenPresent,"Target measurement area contains necrotic tissue or other signs of pathogenic infection. Can be used with FungusPresent when fungal pathogens are suspected or known. This flag is based on visible tissue symptoms, not molecular confirmation."
MoldPresent,"Indicates that the measurement area shows signs of post-mortem fungal growth (e.g., surface mold, fuzz, bloom), likely resulting from poor drying or storage conditions. In practice, mold may be difficult to distinguish from other fungal growth without microscopic or culture analysis. Use judgment and note uncertainty in tissueNotes if needed."
HerbivoryPresent,Target measurement area contains herbivory.
AlcoholPresent,Target measurement area was preserved with ethanol or other alcohol.
PreservativePresent,"Target measurement area contains chemical preservative contamination excluding alcohol preservatives (e.g., diatoms, formaldehyde)."
BurnPresent,Target measurement area contains burned tissue.
DebrisPresent,"Target measurement area contains non-specific material not described in other codes (e.g., dust, soil particles, insect parts, fibers, etc.) that may interfere with clean measurements. Can be elaborated in the tissueNotes field."
