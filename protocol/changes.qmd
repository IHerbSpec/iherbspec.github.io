### Current Version: {{< var protocol_version >}}

### Summary of changes since Version 1.1, v1.11, and v1.12

- Generated new concept DOI from Zenodo: [10.5281/zenodo.18451589](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18451589)
- changed some images from large png to small jpg to reduce pdf size.

### Summary of changes since Version 1.01

- Reorganized the protocol into a Quarto book structure to enable consistent rendering of a single, compiled PDF while preserving the web-based version of the protocol: 
   -- Beginning with this release, versioned snapshots of the IHerbSpec Protocol will be generated **directly from the website source repository** and archived on Zenodo. This change streamlines version control, reduces duplication, and ensures that archived releases correspond exactly to the content presented on the website at the time of release. 
   -- As part of this transition, the **legacy IHerbSpec-protocol GitHub repository will be deprecated**. It will remain available for reference and historical context, but future protocol updates, releases, and Zenodo archives will be managed exclusively through the main IHerbSpec website repository.
   
- Introduced **full title** for the protocol as "Protocol for the Spectral Digitization of Herbarium Specimens". The alternate title "IHerbSpec Protocol" is still used, but the full title is better for a citation that differentiates the author and title.

- Updated **citation**: "IHerbSpec" as author along with full title above.

- Added a Downloads section to the protocol, available in HTML, where users can easily access all tables. These tables are called from in `protocol/tables.qmd` and live in `protocol/tables/`.

- Added this **“Changes Since Last Version”** section to document versioned updates transparently.

- Added logo to homepage and icon to navbar.

- Expanded **Part 5 - Instrumentation and Materials Guidelines** to include guidance on depositing spectral data and metadata in the **IHerbSpec Dataverse**.

- **Section 5.3.2:** Added Fig. 5.1 and new text describing the spectral properties of background materials and their effects on measured leaf reflectance.
