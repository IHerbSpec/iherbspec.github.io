The IHerbSpec Dataverse is a thematic repository for spectral data and metadata derived from herbarium specimens. It supports the goals of the IHerbSpec initiative (<a href="https://iherbspec.github.io" target="_blank">iherbspec.github.io</a>), to establish global standards for the measurement, documentation, and sharing of spectral data from herbarium specimens in biodiversity research. This Dataverse is intended for data archival when spectral data and metadata cannot remain directly linked in specimen data networks. The Project-level Datasets archived here will be curated to follow the IHerbSpec Protocol metadata standards (<a href="https://iherbspec.github.io/protocol.html" target="_blank">iherbspec.github.io/protocol</a>) to ensure their interoperability and reusability.

Please remove or generalize sensitive information before publication (e.g., precise localities of rare taxa, traditional knowledge, or culturally restricted notes).
