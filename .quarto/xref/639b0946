{"entries":[{"caption":"Fig. 1.1. Influence of background on leaf spectral measurements. For a single Rubus idaeus loose leaf (see NEBC 02618198 in Appendix II), the green adaxial surface and strongly glaucous abaxial leaf surface influence strong effects on the spectrum in the visible region (400–700 nm) regardless of paper or black backgrounds. However, the spectra in the near-infrared (700–1,100 nm) and shortwave infrared (1,100–2,500 nm) regions are instead clustered by the background material, revealing both biological and background contamination effects on reflectance spectra. The plot shows target measurements of the white reference, black background, and adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces over black and paper (herbarium sheet) backgrounds. All measurements were made with an SVC HR-1024i spectroradiometer with the LC-RP Pro leaf clip.","key":"fig-1-1","order":{"number":1,"section":[2,2,0,0,0,0,0]}}],"headings":["purpose-and-structure-of-the-iherbspec-protocol","measurement-and-metadata-overview","filename-conventions","white-reference-and-background-measurements","strategy-and-number-of-tissue-measurements","measurement-technique","metadata-requirements-and-flexibility","scoring-metadata-pertaining-to-tissue-condition-and-contamination","specimen-and-tissue-annotation","navigate-the-protocol"],"options":{"fig-title":""}}
