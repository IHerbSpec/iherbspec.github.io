Herbarium sheet is placed on top of the benchtop black background with centimeter rulers at top and left sides for ‘x,y’ notation of measurement area (white dashed circles) in centimeters with 0,0 at the top left. Black background cards are placed under unglued portions of leaves. From left to right, tissue TCAB_TN3 has the location 10,26, tissue TCAD_TN2 has location 17,16 and tissue TCAD_TN1 is stored with a label in a glassine envelope inside the packet with location envelope TCAD_TN1. For reference, specimen NEBC_00651639 metadata fields are proposed in Appendix II.
