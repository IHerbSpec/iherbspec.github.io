    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflectance spectroscopy is a powerful, broadly integrative tool for capturing plant phenotypes. But variation in instrumentation and measurement procedures introduces a high risk of data incompatibility and signal contamination. These challenges are amplified in herbarium specimens because they are subject to complex variation from age, preservation techniques, and mounting practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support global data harmonization and scientific reproducibility, this document presents a standardized, interoperable protocol for the spectral measurement of herbarium tissues. It provides data-driven justification and community-informed guidance for measurement procedures and metadata fields, with the goal of improving data quality and enabling confident data aggregation across institutions.\n",

    "# IHerbSpec and Protocol Development\n",
    "\n",
    "The International Herbarium Spectral Digitization (**IHerbSpec**) Working Group was established in December 2024 as a global consortium focused on advancing the use of reflectance spectroscopy of herbarium specimens for ecological and evolutionary studies.  \n",
    "The group actively collaborates to identify common challenges, facilitate collaborations, and develop best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "This protocol is the outcome of IHerbSpec’s initial collaborative phase. From December 2024 to June 2025, members convened virtually to share project-specific workflows and align measurement strategies. The effort culminated in an in-person workshop at the Harvard University Herbaria (May 1–3, 2025), where members reached consensus on key elements of the protocol, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The minimum and recommended number of measurements for leaf tissues (see [Section 1.2: Stragety and number of tissue measurements](part1-overview.qmd#strategy-and-number-of-tissue-measurements)).  \n",
    "2.  Tissue condition and contamination metadata (see [Section 1.2: Scoring metadata pertaining to tissue condition and contamination](part1-overview.qmd#scoring-metadata-pertaining-to-tissue-condition-and-contamination)).  \n",
    "3.  Tissue development stage metadata (see [Table 4.4](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-4)).\n",
    "\n",
    "IHerbSpec will continue to refine and expand this protocol and welcomes inquiries from interested researchers or institutions wishing to ask questions, provide feedback, or explore opportunities for participation.\n",
