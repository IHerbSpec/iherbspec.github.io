    "# 5.1 Precautions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Carefully handle backgrounds and white references (e.g., Spectralon®):**\n",
    "    -   Use laboratory gloves to handle black backgrounds and white references and tweezers to handle herbarium tissues.  \n",
    "    -   Avoid touching and dirtying the reflective surfaces.  \n",
    "    -   Avoid blowing or cleaning backgrounds and reference standards with canned air, which can cause chemical contamination (other options, such as O2 Hurricane, avoid this contamination).\n",
    "2.  **Avoid burning target tissues:**\n",
    "    -   High light intensities in optical probes can burn tissues, especially thin leaves! Use low light intensity and minimum measurement duration based on manufacturer’s guidance to avoid this.  \n",
    "    -   Avoid measuring tissues with glue on them, whenever possible.  \n",
    "    -   Place a black background under the leaf or target tissue to avoid spectral contamination from the herbarium mounting paper whenever possible. Background surfaces, except for non-reflective black, will influence reflectance spectra (see [Fig. 1.1](part1-overview.qmd#fig-1-1)).\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.2 Spectra Data Files\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Output unprocessed percent reflectance data to files, if possible.**\n",
    "    -   Percent reflectance should be present in the file at the wavelengths directly measured by the instrument.  \n",
    "    -   If instruments and software output transformed data by default (e.g., Spectral Evolution PSR+ output is interpolated at 1 nm resolution), refer to user manuals to change settings to output percent reflectance values at measured wavelengths instead.\n",
    "2.  **File formats differ among spectroradiometer manufacturers, models, and softwares.**\n",
    "    -   Make sure that files include percent reflectance values.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.3 Instrumentation and Materials Quality Control\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Instrument maintenance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Follow manufacturer SOP for spectroradiometer maintenance. If possible, send the instrument to the manufacturer at regular intervals for maintenance (e.g., every two years).  \n",
    "    -   Have fiber optic cables checked by the manufacturer annually and replace damaged fiber optic cables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **For background and white reference measurement requirements, see [Section 1.2](part1-overview.qmd).**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   White reference scans are typically not saved as a separate file, but the white reference digital numbers (raw sensor values) should be included in each target spectrum file (e.g., `.sig` format). These values are used by the instrument software to calculate reflectance from raw radiance.  \n",
    "    -   Black background materials are required to have less than 4% reflectance across all wavelengths (see [Fig. 1.1](part1-overview.qmd#fig-1-1); e.g., IR Flock Sheet from [Musou Black USA](https://musoublackusa.com/products/ir-flock-sheet)).  \n",
    "    -   If measuring leaves on herbarium paper on a benchtop, place a black mat under the herbarium sheets to prevent contaminating reflectance from the benchtop (see [Fig. 4.2](part4-metadata.qmd#fig-4-2)). Black felt (3–5 mm thick) is a practical and cost-effective choice for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Target measurements of background material (black or paper) must be linked to tissue measurements using filename conventions ([Part 3](part3-filenames.qmd)).**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   This supports quality control of background conditions and enables development of spectral unmixing approaches to isolate tissue reflectance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Wear gloves and carefully handle all tissues, white reference, black backgrounds, and calibrated reflectance standards to keep them clean (see [5.1 Precautions](#51-precautions)).**\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Calibrated reflectance standards:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Institutions should consider purchasing calibrated reflectance standards, such as Spectralon® Calibrated (SL Standard) Diffuse Reflectance Standards. These should be kept clean and separate from ‘working’ white references, and used for long-term assessment of instrument performance, optical drift, and the condition of reference materials (e.g., white references and black backgrounds).  \n",
    "    -   These are supplied with a calibration certificate and serial number that verifies reflectance values across wavelengths.  \n",
    "    -   Reflectance standards are white (e.g., Spectralon® 99%) and black (e.g., Spectralon® 2%) at a minimum, and can also include gradations of gray.  \n",
    "    -   It is recommended that standards be measured at regular intervals depending on the level of activity (e.g., once per session; consult spectroradiometer manufacturer), and archived with the filename conventions provided in [Table 3.1](part3-filenames.qmd#tbl-3-1).\n",

    "# 5.4 Specimen and Tissue Annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Metadata recommendation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   IHerbSpec recommends recording the `tissueLocation` metadata field (see [Table 4.3](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-3)) to document the position of measured tissues on the specimen.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Consult with herbarium collections managers** to define a suitable specimen annotation protocol that aligns with institutional policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Recommended specimen annotation practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Attach a project annotation label to the herbarium sheet (e.g., “Leaf spectral reflectance; DM White (2025)”).  \n",
    "    -   Use archival-quality materials for labels and annotations, such as acid-free paper.  \n",
    "    -   Use pencil for direct annotation of measured tissues on sheets.  \n",
    "    -   For loose tissues (from packets or envelopes):\n",
    "        1.  Place the measured tissue in a glassine envelope, which is archival and thin.  \n",
    "        2.  Include a label inside the envelope indicating the `targetTissueClass` and `targetTissueId` (see [Table 4.3](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-3); e.g., “Tissue TN1”).  \n",
    "        3.  Store the envelope in the specimen packet or attach it to the herbarium sheet (see [Fig. 4.2](part4-metadata.qmd#fig-4-2)).\n",
