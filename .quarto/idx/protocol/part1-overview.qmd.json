For a single *Rubus idaeus* loose leaf (see NEBC 02618198 in [Appendix II](appendix2.qmd)), the green adaxial surface and strongly glaucous abaxial leaf surface influence strong effects on the spectrum in the visible region (400–700 nm) regardless of paper or black backgrounds. However, the spectra in the near-infrared (700–1,100 nm) and shortwave infrared (1,100–2,500 nm) regions are instead clustered by the background material, revealing both biological and background contamination effects on reflectance spectra. The plot shows target measurements of the white reference, black background, and adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces over black and paper (herbarium sheet) backgrounds. All measurements were made with an SVC HR-1024i spectroradiometer with the LC-RP Pro leaf clip.](images/Fig1.1-spectrabg.png){#fig-1-1 fig-align=\"center\" width=\"800px\"}\n\n## 1.2.3 Strategy and Number of Tissue Measurements\n\n- **Tissue selection strategy**  \n  - Considerations and guidelines for selecting specimens and tissues for measurement are provided in [Part 6](part6-guidelines.qmd), including a decision tree diagram ([Fig. 6.1](part6-guidelines.qmd#fig-6-1)).\n\n- **The number of leaf tissue measurements per specimen**  \n  - If both adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces are accessible and suitable, **a minimum of three representative measurements per surface (six total) is required per specimen**. If only one surface is available or if the tissue class is `leaf` with undifferentiated abaxial/adaxial surfaces (see [Table 4.5](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-5)), then a minimum of three representative measurements are required.  \n    - Representative measurements should be free of technical errors and generally reproducible (see Section 6.2; [Appendix I](appendix1.qmd)).  \n  - Five or more representative measurements per available and suitable leaf tissue class (adaxial, abaxial, or leaf) are recommended (see [Appendix I](appendix1.qmd) for discussion).\n\n  *Adaptability:* Projects may choose to collect measurements from a single leaf or from multiple leaves to capture tissue- versus specimen-level variability. The different tissue units are recommended to be distinguished using the `targetTissueId` field and be identifiable via annotation labels and/or their location on the specimen (see [Table 4.3](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-3)).\n\n- **Other tissue classes**  \n  - **No required minimum** is prescribed.  \n  - **Recommended**: At least three representative measurements per specimen per tissue class, if feasible.  \n\n---\n\n## 1.2.4 Measurement Technique\n\n- Multiple measurements per tissue unit may be taken by targeting multiple suitable areas on the tissue or—taking care not to heat-damage the tissue—by targeting a small area and slightly rotating or shifting the optical probe between measurements.  \n- Avoid overlapping tissue layers, debris, or partial coverage of the probe aperture (Fig. A1).  \n- If a measurement appears affected by technical error, delete and repeat it.  \n\n---\n\n## 1.2.5 Metadata Requirements and Flexibility\n\n- All required and recommended protocol metadata are available for use in the IHerbSpec Metadata Spreadsheet, which can be downloaded on the [protocol home page](https://iherbspec.github.io/protocol).  \n- The protocol recommends recording tissue metadata for every individual measurement because every measurement will generate a spectra data file. This means that **every tissue measurement will be recorded in a unique row in the metadata spreadsheet** (e.g., 10 measurements have 10 rows).  \n- All fields in Session metadata ([Table 4.1](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-1)), Specimen Metadata ([Table 4.2](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-2)), and Tissue Metadata ([Table 4.3](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-3)) are marked as required or recommended in the field descriptions.  \n\n---\n\n## 1.2.6 Scoring Metadata Pertaining to Tissue Condition and Contamination\n\n- To record key elements of tissue condition and contamination, these fields are required metadata (see [Section 6.1](part6-guidelines.qmd#sources-of-variation-in-herbarium-plant-tissues); field descriptions in [Table 4.3](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-3)):  \n  - `tissueDevelopmentalStage`  \n  - `hasGlue`  \n  - `hasNonGlueContamination`  \n\n- To further describe tissue conditions, the `measurementFlags` and `tissueNotes` fields are **recommended**:  \n  - `measurementFlags` allows use of standardized tissue condition descriptors (see [Table 4.6](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-6)) for preservation status, damage, or contamination (e.g., `GoodPreservation`|`GluePresent`).  \n  - `tissueNotes` enables free-text documentation of additional tissue conditions or context inside or outside the measurement area.  \n\n*Adaptability:*  \n- `tissueDevelopmentalStage` may be coded as `notScored` if assessment is not possible (e.g., due to technician training or specimen condition; see [Table 4.4](part4-metadata.qmd#tbl-4-4)).  \n- `hasGlue` and `hasNonGlueContamination` may be marked `uncertain` if presence is not confidently determined.  \n\n---\n\n## 1.2.7 Specimen and Tissue Annotation\n\n- The IHerbSpec Protocol recommends annotating the location of measured tissues on the sheet using the `targetTissueId` field. Additional annotations to the herbarium sheet or packet are encouraged in accordance with herbarium policies (see [Section 5.4](part5-instrumentation.qmd#specimen-and-tissue-annotation)). \n\n---\n\n# Navigate the protocol\n- Proceed to [**Part 2**](part2-workflow.qmd)\n\nBrowse additional parts and appendices:\n\n- [**Part 1**](part1-overview.qmd) – Overview  \n- [**Part 2**](part2-workflow.qmd) – Measurement and Metadata Workflow  \n- [**Part 3**](part3-filenames.qmd) – Filename Conventions and Formats  \n- [**Part 4**](part4-metadata.qmd) – Metadata and Databasing  \n- [**Part 5**](part5-instrumentation.qmd) – Instrumentation and Materials Guidelines  \n- [**Part 6**](part6-guidelines.qmd) – Selecting Tissues for Spectral Measurement  \n- [**References**](references.qmd)\n- [**Appendix I**](appendix1.qmd) – Number of Measurements per Tissue  \n- [**Appendix II**](appendix2.qmd) – Tissue Metadata for Quality Control  \n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<!-- Page-only styles -->\n<style>\n  .content-narrow {\n    max-width: 100ch;\n    margin-left: auto;\n    margin-right: auto;\n    font-size: 1.05rem;\n    line-height: 1.7;\n  }\n</style>\n\n\n# 1.1 Purpose and Structure of the IHerbSpec Protocol\n\nThis document outlines a “base” protocol for the spectroscopic measurement of herbarium plant tissues by defining clear minimum requirements and additional recommended practices that promote data quality, methodological consistency, reproducibility, and interoperability across projects and institutions.
