    "text": "Spectral measurements of plant tissues are highly sensitive to both instrument configuration and small spatial differences across target tissue. Changes in the optical probe geometry in relation to the tissue—such as tilting, poor contact with the leaf surface, partial coverage of the measurement area (Fig. A1), or micro-contaminants like debris—can introduce technical errors. In addition, leaf surface microtopography, anatomical variation, and alterations from herborization (e.g., drying distortion, discoloration, or degradation) all contribute to variation in reflectance spectra (Cavender-Bares et al. 2025).\n\n\n\nFig. A1: Variability in spectral measurements due to instrument configuration and technical error. The following spectral measurements are shown: white calibration standard (red), black background (orange), standard adaxial measurement with black background (light green), standard adaxial measurement but with narrow-angle lens following recalibration (dark green), adaxial measurement where the tissue did not fully cover the optical field of view (i.e., backgroundInMeasurement = TRUE; blue), and a folded leaf (purple). All measurements were made of the same tissue using an SVC HR-1024i spectroradiometer.\n\n\nThese considerations support the IHerbSpec Protocol requirement of collecting a minimum of three representative measurements per adaxial and abaxial leaf surface, when suitable tissues for both surfaces are available. Three measurements are necessary to calculate a mean spectrum and its variance. The protocol further recommends collecting five measurements per surface to achieve a more robust spectral characterization and to meet the threshold for improved performance in classification models. The protocol allows for users to make these minimum or higher measurements across one or many leaves. For other tissue types, at least three measurements are recommended, with more encouraged when feasible. Below, we elaborate justification for this recommendation.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated improved model performance when multiple measurements per individual specimen are averaged, including those by Durgante et al. (2013; Figs. A2, A3), Neto-Bradley et al. (2025), and S. Bazan et al. (Unpubl.). The IHerbSpec Protocol’s recommendation of five measurements is based on empirical evidence that model accuracy gains tend to stabilize beyond five to ten measurements per tissue (Fig. A2), although the optimal number may vary depending on tissue type, instrument sensitivity, and modeling goals. Beyond classification, IHerbSpec members are investigating how replicate measurements affect the accuracy and robustness of trait prediction models, evaluating both the benefits of averaging spectra and the variation in predicted trait values from unaveraged measurements of the same tissue.\n\n\n\nFig. A2: Accuracy of taxonomic discrimination as a function of the number of averaged measurements per specimen. Three tissue class datasets are analyzed: combined adaxial and abaxial spectra (circles), abaxial only (squares), and adaxial only (triangles). Each point represents the average classification accuracy from 50 replicate linear discriminant analysis models, using randomized subsampling and test set validation. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The vertical gray line marks the minimum number of spectral measurements (n = 5), below which accuracy significantly decreases (Tukey test, P ≤ 0.05). Data were collected using an FT-NIR spectrometer (1000–2500 nm) from 10 species in Lecythidaceae, including eight Eschweilera and two Corythophora species. Accuracy increases notably between one and five spectra per specimen, after which performance stabilizes, indicating diminishing returns beyond five measurements. This figure is reproduced from Durgante et al. (2013) with permission from the publisher.\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. A3: Spectral variability as a function of the number of measurements averaged per measurement. Here, a total of 100 spectral measurements were collected from a single Annona sp. leaf using an ASD LabSpec Pro spectrometer over a black background. Subsets of these measurements were then averaged in groups ranging from 2 to 40 to simulate different measurement strategies. The plot shows the root mean square (RMS) distance between replicate spectra as a function of the number of measurements averaged, illustrating that spectral variability decreases substantially as more measurements are combined. Notably, averaging fewer than five measurements did not adequately capture intra-tissue spectral variation. This analysis supported the required minimum of 10 measurements per specimen for the formal protocol currently implemented by teams at CIRAD and IRD in France (Mersni et al. 2025).\n\n\nAnother important recommendation in the IHerbSpec Protocol is to measure both adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces. These surfaces differ in anatomy and function due to evolutionary adaptations for light capture, gas exchange, and environmental stress. Such structural differences are consistently reflected in their spectral signatures (see Fig. 1.1), and we recommend measuring both surfaces—when suitable tissue is accessible—to capture this biologically meaningful variation.\nWithin the context of a large-scale macroevolutionary project focusing on Annonaceae (ERC GLOBAL project; PI Thomas Couvreur), researchers aimed to measure spectra on one specimen per species with the intent to capture as much variation as possible for each specimen. In accordance with the protocol established at the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD), researchers decided to make 20 spectral measurements per specimen to develop their spectral library for 1700 Annonaceae species preserved in over 30 different herbaria.\nThis decision was informed by preliminary experiments demonstrating that spectral stability improves with larger numbers of measurements (Fig. A3). The choice of 20 spectra was also appropriate because of variation in the number and size of leaves, allowing for multiple measurements of multiple leaves or single large leaves that filled an entire herbarium sheet. It also allowed for poor-quality spectra to be discarded based on downstream filtering criteria while still retaining a large number of measurements per specimen.\nOverall, given the sensitivity of spectral data, research projects are encouraged—when feasible—to collect more than five measurements per tissue, including across different tissue units within an individual. This enables further assessment of intra-individual spectral heterogeneity and its impact on downstream analyses.\nThe marginal cost of additional measurements is relatively low across instruments, with a single measurement typically completed within 1 to 10 seconds. Nevertheless, determining the appropriate number of measurements remains a critical design consideration, particularly in large-scale digitization projects involving significant resource investment."

    "text": "Spectral data from herbarium specimens are influenced by two major sources of variation.\nThe first is the natural biological variation of phenotypes constructed through genotype-by-environment interactions that biologists seek to understand. This includes differences in developmental stage (e.g., young, mature, senescent), within-individual morphological variation (e.g., sun vs. shade leaves), and biotic influences such as herbivory or pathogens.\nThe second source is herborization-related variation—herborization being defined as the process of preserving plant tissues in an herbarium, from the time of collection through long-term storage. This includes collection, pressing, drying, application of preservatives, and subsequent storage conditions. Each of these steps will affect the spectral data to some extent.\nFor example, differences in technique (e.g., bagged vs. immediately pressed specimens; use of ethanol) and environmental factors during drying and storage can lead to discoloration, dehydration, tissue distortion, and contamination from biotic or abiotic agents such as fungus, glue, or insecticides.

    "section": "General Guidelines for Tissue Selection",
    "text": "General Guidelines for Tissue Selection\nNote: Much of this text is tailored to measuring leaf tissues, but can generally be applied to other tissues.\n\nQuality over quantity.\n\nUnder the goal of broad digitization of herbarium tissues, spectral data quality could be considered more important than specimen quantity. Targeting higher quality, less degraded specimens will yield more informative spectral data.\n\nIf the majority of tissues on a specimen are degraded, damaged, or contaminated, that specimen should generally not be measured unless it holds particular research value.\n\nSelect specimens based on their general tissue condition:\n\nFor digitization projects focused on broad taxonomic coverage, specimens should be evaluated as whole units when determining suitability for spectral measurement. Next, technicians should prioritize tissues that are both suitable for measurement and representative of the overall condition of the specimen, rather than selecting isolated tissues that are in unusually good condition. This approach helps ensure alignment between the general specimen condition and the resulting spectral data, and could avoid biases based on assumptions of exceptional tissue conditions. If the majority of tissues on a specimen are degraded, damaged, or contaminated, that specimen should generally not be measured unless it holds particular research value. Conversely, if the specimen consists mostly of clean, mature, fully expanded tissues, it is appropriate to proceed with measurement—while also considering additional measurements, when feasible, to capture variation such as developmental stage or damage from herbivory and scoring the appropriate metadata for these additional measurements.\n\nCaveat: while the overall condition of the specimen informs whether it should be measured, metadata on developmental stage, contamination, and tissue condition should always record the characteristics of the specific measurement area of the tissue—not the specimen as a whole. This ensures metadata accuracy and supports high-resolution filtering and analysis. Information about the specimen can be recorded in the tissueNotes field (Table 4.3).\n\nScore metadata with care.\n\nMetadata collection is a critical component for understanding factors affecting spectral data quality and will provide confidence during data aggregation.\n\nHerbaria and research teams should train technicians in specimen selection strategies and scoring metadata to reduce subjectivity.\n\nPrioritize:\n\nTissue measurements on black backgrounds.\n\nDetached tissues of appropriate size in fragment packets allow full assessment of the presence of glue and access to both leaf surfaces.\n\nFor mounted specimens, taped or sewn tissues can have black backing inserted beneath (technicians should look for evidence of old glue).\n\n\nSpecimens with mature tissues (e.g., fully expanded leaves) that are clean of biotic or abiotic contaminants.\n\nTissues that fill the probe measurement area, even if midvein is measured.\n\nLeaves with flat, complete surfaces and intact laminae.\n\nAvoid:\n\nTissues with glue.\n\nTissues attached to herbarium paper such that no black background can be inserted beneath the tissue.\n\nTissues that are not pressed flat (e.g., deformed, folded, crumpled, or abnormal leaves).\n\nTissues contaminated by biotic or abiotic agents (e.g., algae, lichen, fungus, chemical preservatives, glue).\n\nDamaged tissues (e.g., by herbivory, pathogens, herborization phenomena).\n\nMidribs and major venation in the leaves, or other types of vasculature or intrusions in target tissue.\n\nIf larger tissues are available, avoid smaller tissues that don’t cover the entire optical probe measurement area.\n\nMeasuring small tissues:\nMeasuring taxa with naturally small tissues presents unique challenges, but several strategies can help obtain representative spectral measurements with minimal error.\n\nCenter the probe on multiple areas of the small tissue and collect several measurements, then average the values to represent the tissue’s spectral profile.\n\nCreate a mosaic by arranging multiple small tissue units side by side to fill the measurement area. Avoid overlapping tissues, as stacking can alter light scattering and distort reflectance values (Fig. A1).\n\nConsider optical setup with small measurement area: For projects in the instrument selection phase, Spectral Evolution offers a custom optical probe with a 2-mm measurement area compatible with their NaturaSpec and PSR spectroradiometers.\n\nAvoid using narrow angle lenses as these might distort the spectrum (Fig. A1).\n\nMultiple individual plants within one herbarium sheet:\n\nEach individual plant on a sheet should be demarcated with a unique specimenId ( Table 4.2)."

Tissues that are simply discolored may still be considered well preserved if other aspects of integrity are maintained.\n\n\nMediumPreservation\nTissue in the measurement area shows moderate degradation, such as partial discoloration, wilting, or deformation. Some structural loss may be present, though not severe. Evidence of degradation from other parts of the specimen (e.g., mold elsewhere on the tissue) may support assigning this level of preservation, but such observations should be recorded in tissueNotes if not present within the measurement area. This is expected to be the most common preservation condition for herbarium specimens used in spectral measurement.\n\n\nPoorPreservation\nTissue in the measurement area shows clear signs of degradation, including severe discoloration, wrinkling, deformation, or breakage. Mold, insect damage, or other signs of poor preservation may also be present. As with other flags, evidence of degradation outside the measurement area (e.g., mold elsewhere on the tissue) may support the assigned flag but should be recorded in tissueNotes if not directly observed in the measurement area. Note that natural discoloration tendencies of certain taxa should be considered when applying this flag (see Appendix II).\n\n\nMidveinPresent\nTarget measurement area contains midvein or similarly prominent secondary venation.\n\n\nOrganismPresent\nIndicates that a visible organism (e.g., bryophyte, lichen, fungal structure) is present on or within the measurement area. This includes epiphyllous, endophytic, or other leaf-associated organisms, regardless of their ecological role (e.g., mutualistic, parasitic, or incidental). This flag serves as a general indicator and can be used in conjunction with more specific organism flags below.\n\n\nBryophytePresent\nIndicates that a visible bryophyte (e.g., moss, liverwort, or hornwort) is present on or within the measurement area.\n\n\nLichenPresent\nIndicates that a visible lichen thallus or fragment is present on or within the measurement area.\n\n\nFungusPresent\nIndicates that fungal structures are visible in the measurement area (e.g., hyphae, mycelium, fruiting body) and are presumed to be pre-mortem associates, such as endophytes or pathogens active while the plant was alive. This flag can overlap with PathogenPresent or MoldPresent.\n\n\nPathogenPresent\nTarget measurement area contains necrotic tissue or other signs of pathogenic infection. Can be used with FungusPresent when fungal pathogens are suspected or known. This flag is based on visible tissue symptoms, not molecular confirmation.\n\n\nMoldPresent\nIndicates that the measurement area shows signs of post-mortem fungal growth (e.g., surface mold, fuzz, bloom), likely resulting from poor drying or storage conditions. In practice, mold may be difficult to distinguish from other fungal growth without microscopic or culture analysis. Use judgment and note uncertainty in tissueNotes if needed.\n\n\nHerbivoryPresent\nTarget measurement area contains herbivory.\n\n\nAlcoholPresent\nTarget measurement area was preserved with ethanol or other alcohol.\n\n\nPreservativePresent\nTarget measurement area contains chemical preservative contamination excluding alcohol preservatives (e.g., diatoms, formaldehyde).\n\n\nBurnPresent\nTarget measurement area contains burned tissue.\n\n\nDebrisPresent\nTarget measurement area contains non-specific material not described in other codes (e.g., dust, soil particles, insect parts, fibers, etc.) that may interfere with clean measurements.

    "section": "4.3 Guidelines for Data Archiving and Sharing",
    "text": "4.3 Guidelines for Data Archiving and Sharing\n\nFor each specimen, a copy of all unprocessed spectral files and associated metadata should be archived by the herbarium or institution that owns the specimen, or otherwise managed in accordance with institutional data storage practices. Wherever possible, these data should remain co-located with specimen records or stored in infrastructure (e.g., institutional servers, cloud services, or collection management systems) that supports long-term stewardship, identifier stability, and integration with specimen metadata.\nIn addition to institutional archiving, projects are strongly encouraged to deposit unprocessed spectral data files and metadata in a persistent, open-access repository that issues DOIs and supports versioning.\nThe IHerbSpec Dataverse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/iherbspec/) is a community-curated, thematic repository designed specifically to serve herbarium spectral data and metadata. It provides free access, dataset-level versioning, rich metadata support, and curation aligned with the IHerbSpec Protocol. Datasets deposited in the IHerbSpec Dataverse can be linked to specimen records in primary digitization platforms (e.g., Symbiota, Specify, Tropicos) using stable identifiers and resource relationships, enabling integration across systems while allowing spectral data to be managed in infrastructure optimized for these data types.\nThe IHerbSpec Dataverse supports a project-based data sharing model, suitable for laboratory studies, collaborative research projects, and digitization efforts that span multiple collections. Datasets may include raw spectra, metadata spreadsheets, README documentation, processed spectra, and associated trait data. Metadata are reviewed prior to release to promote compliance with the IHerbSpec Protocol and to facilitate interoperability and reuse.\nTo enhance discoverability and specimen-level integration, datasets archived in external repositories (including the IHerbSpec Dataverse) may be linked to specimen records using standardized associations (e.g., Darwin Core Resource Relationship terms such as isReferencedBy). These links can be prepared in bulk and ingested by specimen portals, allowing users to search for specimens associated with spectral data while the files themselves remain hosted in the most appropriate repository.\nTo facilitate reuse and analysis, projects may also share tabular data files (e.g., .csv) containing samples in rows and spectral bands and metadata fields in columns. If processed spectra are included (e.g., interpolated, splice-corrected, continuum-removed), all applied processing steps should be clearly documented.\nWhen projects include additional trait data alongside spectral measurements, contributors should ensure that trait definitions, units, and measurement methods are clearly documented and standardized where possible. Ongoing community efforts will be required to align spectral data with broader trait data standards and repositories.\nContributors should consider data governance needs, including sensitive specimen information, traditional knowledge considerations, access restrictions, and long-term curation responsibilities. The IHerbSpec community is actively developing governance, curation, and review practices to support responsible data sharing consistent with FAIR and CARE principles.\nThe IHerbSpec community is also working toward the development of software tools to automatically validate metadata, filenames, and dataset structure against the IHerbSpec Protocol during data submission, and to enable future parsing of bulk datasets into specimen-specific subsets for downstream integration and reuse.\nSee an example of spectral data and metadata sharing here:\nhttps://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LXPHBC —"

    "text": "IHerbSpec and Protocol Development\nThe International Herbarium Spectral Digitization Working Group (IHerbSpec) was established in December 2024 as a global consortium focused on advancing the use of reflectance spectroscopy of herbarium specimens for ecological and evolutionary studies.\nThe group actively collaborates to identify common challenges, facilitate collaborations, and develop best practices.\nThis protocol is one of the primary products of IHerbSpec’s initial collaborative phase. From December 2024 to June 2025, members convened virtually to share project-specific workflows and align measurement strategies. The protocol was developed through an open, collaborative process, with a majority of IHerbSpec members contributing to discussions and decisions and serving as authors. The effort culminated in an in-person workshop at the Harvard University Herbaria (May 1–3, 2025), where members reached consensus on key elements of the protocol, including:\n\nThe minimum and recommended number of measurements for leaf tissues (see Strategy and number of tissue measurements).\nTissue condition and contamination metadata (see Scoring metadata pertaining to tissue condition and contamination).\nTissue development stage metadata (see Table 4.4).\n\nIHerbSpec will continue to refine and expand this protocol and welcomes inquiries from interested researchers or institutions wishing to ask questions, provide feedback, or explore opportunities for participation."

This change streamlines version control, reduces duplication, and ensures that archived releases correspond exactly to the content presented on the website at the time of release. – As part of this transition, the legacy IHerbSpec-protocol GitHub repository will be deprecated. It will remain available for reference and historical context, but future protocol updates, releases, and Zenodo archives will be managed exclusively through the main IHerbSpec website repository.\nIntroduced full title for the protocol as “Protocol for the Spectral Digitization of Herbarium Specimens”. The alternate title “IHerbSpec Protocol” is still used, but the full title is better for a citation that differentiates the author and title.\nUpdated citation: “IHerbSpec” as author along with full title above.\nAdded a Downloads section to the protocol, available in HTML, where users can easily access all tables.

    "section": "1.2 Measurement and Metadata Overview",
    "text": "1.2 Measurement and Metadata Overview\nThis section provides a quick conceptual guide to the required and recommended components of the protocol with relevant notes on adaptability.\n\n1.2.1 Filename Conventions\nTo ensure key identifiability components for every unprocessed spectra file (white target, black target, calibrated reflectance standards, tissues), the IHerbSpec Protocol strongly recommends using the filename formats described in Part 3.\nAdaptability: Projects may use simplified filenames (see Table 3.1) during metadata scoring, then convert to the full format for permanent storage and distribution.\n\n\n1.2.2 White Reference and Background Measurements\n\nWhite-reference measurements are required at the start of each session and at regular intervals (e.g., every 20 minutes; check manufacturer guidance).\n\nThis measurement is not recorded as a unique file (see Section 5.3).\nA measurement session is defined as the period between switching the instrument on and off.\n\nWhite, black, and/or gray calibrated reflectance standard target measurements are recommended to be taken at the beginning of each measurement session or at regular intervals (e.g. once per week) and be locally archived (see Section 5.3).\nA single white target measurement is required at the beginning of each session to confirm instrument performance (see Fig. 1.1).\n\nIt is strongly recommended to use the sessionId field in filenames in order to link the white-reference spectrum to every tissue measurement in the session (see Table 4.1).\n\nThe protocol requires projects to use a &lt;4% reflective black surface whenever possible as a background behind tissues during measurement (Section 5.3).\n\nA black-background target measurement is required at the start of each session (see Fig. 1.1).\nIt is strongly recommended to use the sessionId field in filenames in order to link the black-background spectrum to every tissue measurement in the session (see Table 4.1).\n\nIf tissues are glued and must be measured against herbarium sheet paper as the background, then a paper background target measurement must be taken and linked to the corresponding tissue spectra (Fig. 1.1; Part 3).\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1.1. Influence of background on leaf spectral measurements. For a single Rubus idaeus loose leaf (see NEBC 02618198 in Appendix II), the green adaxial surface and strongly glaucous abaxial leaf surface are separated spectrally in the visible region (400–700 nm) regardless of paper or black backgrounds. However, the spectra in the near-infrared (700–1,100 nm) and shortwave infrared (1,100–2,500 nm) regions are different as they cluster by the background material, revealing both biological and background contamination effects on reflectance spectra. The plot shows target measurements of the white reference, black background, and adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces over black and paper (herbarium sheet) backgrounds. All measurements were made with an SVC HR-1024i spectroradiometer with the LC-RP Pro leaf clip.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Strategy and Number of Tissue Measurements\n\nTissue selection strategy\n\nConsiderations and guidelines for selecting specimens and tissues for measurement are provided in Part 6, including a decision tree diagram (Fig. 6.1).\n\nThe number of leaf tissue measurements per specimen\n\nIf both adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces are accessible and suitable, a minimum of three representative measurements per surface (six total) is required per specimen. If only one surface is available or if the tissue class is leaf with undifferentiated abaxial/adaxial surfaces (see Table 4.5), then a minimum of three representative measurements are required.\n\nRepresentative measurements should be free of technical errors and generally reproducible (see Section 6.2; Appendix I).\n\n\nFive or more representative measurements per available and suitable leaf tissue class (adaxial, abaxial, or leaf) are recommended (see Appendix I for discussion).\n\nAdaptability: Projects may choose to collect measurements from a single leaf or from multiple leaves to capture tissue- versus specimen-level variability. The different tissue units are recommended to be distinguished using the targetTissueId field and be identifiable via annotation labels and/or their location on the specimen (see Table 4.3).\nOther tissue classes\n\nNo required minimum is prescribed.\n\nRecommended: At least three representative measurements per specimen per tissue class, if feasible.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Measurement Technique\n\nMultiple measurements per tissue unit may be taken by targeting multiple suitable areas on the tissue or—taking care not to heat-damage the tissue—by targeting a small area and slightly rotating or shifting the optical probe between measurements.\n\nAvoid overlapping tissue layers, debris, or partial coverage of the probe aperture (Fig. A1).\n\nIf a measurement appears affected by technical error, delete and repeat it.\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Metadata Requirements and Flexibility\n\nAll required and recommended protocol metadata are available for use in the IHerbSpec Metadata Spreadsheet, which can be downloaded on the protocol home page.\n\nThe protocol recommends recording tissue metadata for every individual measurement because every measurement will generate a spectral data file. This means that every tissue measurement will be recorded in a unique row in the metadata spreadsheet (e.g., 10 measurements have 10 rows).\n\nAll fields in Session metadata (Table 4.1), Specimen Metadata (Table 4.2), and Tissue Metadata (Table 4.3) are marked as required or recommended in the field descriptions.\n\n\n\n1.2.6 Scoring Metadata Pertaining to Tissue Condition and Contamination\n\nTo record key elements of tissue condition and contamination, these fields are required metadata (see Section 6.1; field descriptions in Table 4.3):\n\ntissueDevelopmentalStage\n\nhasGlue\n\nhasNonGlueContamination\n\nTo further describe tissue conditions, the measurementFlags and tissueNotes fields are recommended:\n\nmeasurementFlags allows use of standardized tissue condition descriptors (see Table 4.6) for preservation status, damage, or contamination (e.g., GoodPreservation|GluePresent).\n\ntissueNotes enables free-text documentation of additional tissue conditions or context inside or outside the measurement area.\n\n\nAdaptability:\n\ntissueDevelopmentalStage may be coded as notScored if assessment is not possible (e.g., due to technician training or specimen condition; see Table 4.4).\n\nhasGlue and hasNonGlueContamination may be marked uncertain if presence is not confidently determined.\n\n\n\n1.2.7 Specimen and Tissue Annotation\n\nThe IHerbSpec Protocol recommends annotating the location of measured tissues on the sheet using the targetTissueId field. Additional annotations to the herbarium sheet or packet are encouraged in accordance with herbarium policies (see Section 5.4)."

    "text": "5.3 Instrumentation and Materials Quality Control\n5.3.1. Instrument maintenance:\n\nFollow manufacturer SOP for spectroradiometer maintenance. If possible, send the instrument to the manufacturer at regular intervals for maintenance (e.g., every two years).\n\nHave fiber optic cables checked by the manufacturer annually and replace damaged fiber optic cables. You can test the integrity of the cables by shining a flashlight through one end of the fiberoptic and observing the light transmitted out the other side.\n\n5.3.2. For background and white reference measurement requirements, see Section 1.2.2.\n\nBackground materials are not spectrally neutral and exhibit distinct reflectance profiles that can introduce systematic, wavelength-dependent biases into leaf spectral measurements (Fig. 5.1). These effects are especially pronounced in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared regions, underscoring the importance of consistent background selection and documentation for reproducible and comparable spectral data.\nWhite reference scans are typically not saved as a separate file, but the white reference digital numbers (raw sensor values) should be included in each target spectrum file (e.g., .sig format). These values are used by the instrument software to calculate reflectance from raw radiance.\n\nBlack background materials are required to have &lt;4% reflectance across all wavelengths (see Fig. 1.1; e.g., IR Flock Sheet from Musou Black USA).\n\nIf measuring leaves on herbarium paper on a benchtop, place a black mat under the herbarium sheets to prevent contaminating reflectance from the benchtop (see Fig. 4.2). Black felt (3–5 mm thick) is a practical and cost-effective choice for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 5.1. Reflectance of different background materials and their effects on target tissue spectra. (A) Reflectance spectra of common background materials used in herbarium spectral measurements, including black (Musou IR Flock), dark grey, light grey (grey matte paint on canvas), white (Spectralon 99%), and three herbarium mounting paper types of different ages. Each background exhibits a distinct spectral profile across the visible–shortwave infrared range (400—2500 nm). (B) Differences between adaxial leaf spectra measured on black background (TCAD_BGB) with spectra of the same leaf surface measured on the other backgrounds (see legend). Deviations from zero indicate wavelength-dependent background-induced biases, which are greatest in the near-infrared (NIR; c. 700—1100 nm) and shortwave infrared I regions (SWIR 1; 1100—2000 nm). (C) Reflectance spectra of leaf abaxial surface (TCAB) measured on different backgrounds, illustrating how background reflectance can influence absolute reflectance values across spectral regions. (D) Mean reflectance spectra of leaf adaxial surface (TCAD) measured on different backgrounds, showing similar background-dependent effects. All measurements were made with a Spectral Evolution NaturaSpec spectroradiometer using a handheld herbarium leaf probe.\n\n\n5.3.3. Target measurements of background material (black or paper) must be linked to tissue measurements using filename conventions (Part 3).\n\nThis supports quality control of background conditions and enables development of spectral unmixing approaches to isolate tissue reflectance.\n\n5.3.4. Wear gloves and carefully handle all tissues, white reference, black backgrounds, and calibrated reflectance standards to keep them clean (see 5.1 Precautions).\n5.3.5. Calibrated reflectance standards:\n\nInstitutions should consider purchasing calibrated reflectance standards, such as Spectralon® Calibrated (SL Standard) Diffuse Reflectance Standards. These should be kept clean and separate from ‘working’ white references, and used for long-term assessment of instrument performance, optical drift, and the condition of reference materials (e.g., white references and black backgrounds).\n\nThese are supplied with a calibration certificate and serial number that verifies reflectance values across wavelengths.\n\nReflectance standards are white (e.g., Spectralon® 99%) and black (e.g., Spectralon® 2%) at a minimum, and can also include gradations of gray.\n\nIt is recommended that standards be measured at regular intervals depending on the level of activity (e.g., once per session; consult spectroradiometer manufacturer), and archived with the filename conventions provided in Table 3.1."

    "section": "Scoring metadata for tissue conditions",
    "text": "Scoring metadata for tissue conditions\nAs explained in Section 6.1 Sources of Variation, we aim to capture biological variation that is scientifically meaningful, but the degraded nature of herbarium specimens requires a careful assessment and annotation of tissue quality and sources of contamination. The Tissue Metadata fields of, developmentalStage, hasGlue, hasNonGlueContamination, measurementFlags, and tissueNotes Table 4.3 are designed to support quality control of spectral data and enable downstream filtering.\nThe codes for enumerating the developmentalStage fields are provided in Table 4.4, and the codes for measurementFlags are described in Table 4.6.\nTechnicians should also be aware that some taxa (e.g. Myrtaceae) or tropical collections in general may naturally exhibit discoloration or non-flat, deformed surfaces (e.g., Gasteranthus atratus). Such characteristics do not necessarily indicate tissue degradation and poor-quality spectral data. In addition, some taxa exhibit more pronounced discoloration during herborization as a result of their biology, and such discoloration should not be interpreted as evidence of poor preservation condition. Some traits also covary; for example, young leaves wilt and become discolored faster and are more challenging to press and dry flat, so they may more often be scored as moderately or poorly preserved.\nAs a reminder, measurementFlags pertain only to the measurement area, not the whole tissue unit (e.g., leaf). Since suitable measurement areas of tissues (see decision tree in Fig. 6.1) will not contain any contaminants, pathogens, or other damage, technicians should not be enumerating any codes in the measurementFlags field. This could differ in projects collecting measurements pertaining to extended uses of the specimen, e.g., symbionts, degradation, etc., that might be measuring tissue areas with these other features.\nThe specimens and metadata examples in Table A1 have been selected to guide consistent scoring of these fields during spectral measurement and promote metadata consistency across projects. Note that the images do not specify the exact measurement area corresponding to these metadata fields (as is done in the IHerbSpec Metadata Spreadsheet for specimen NEBC_00651639 shown in main text Fig. 2.2).\n\nTable A1: Examples for Scoring of Tissue Conditions.\nThis table provides example metadata records for herbarium specimens, illustrating how to score select Tissue Metadata Table 4.3 related to condition and contamination. The fields developmentalStage, hasGlue, hasNonGlueContamination, and measurementFlags refer specifically to the measurement area. Broader observations about the specimen or other tissues can be recorded in tissueNotes (see Table 4.3). Linked specimen images are included, though they do not indicate the precise measurement area corresponding to each metadata record.\nDownload TableA1.csv\n\n\n\n\nherbariumCode_specimenID\ndevelopmental Stage\nhasGlue\nhasNonGlue Contamination\nmeasurement Flags\ntissueNotes\n\n\n\n\nA_00631088\nmature\nTRUE\nFALSE\nMediumPreservation\ndiscolored\n\n\nA_00672503\nmature\nFALSE\nTRUE\nGoodPreservation\nPathogenPresent\n\n\nA_00746288\nmature\nTRUE\nFALSE\nMediumPreservation\nDiscolored.
