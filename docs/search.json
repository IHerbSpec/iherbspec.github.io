    "text": "6.1 Sources of Variation in Herbarium Plant Tissues\nSpectral data from herbarium specimens are influenced by two major sources of variation.\nThe first is the natural biological variation of phenotypes constructed through genotype-by-environment interactions that biologists seek to understand. This includes differences in developmental stage (e.g., young, mature, senescent), within-individual morphological variation (e.g., sun vs. shade leaves), and biotic influences such as herbivory or pathogens.\nThe second source is herborization-related variation—herborization being defined as the process of preserving plant tissues in an herbarium, from the time of collection through long-term storage. This includes collection, pressing, drying, application of preservatives, and subsequent storage conditions. Each of these steps will affect the spectral data to some extent.\nFor example, differences in technique (e.g., bagged vs. immediately pressed specimens; use of ethanol) and environmental factors during drying and storage can lead to discoloration, dehydration, tissue distortion, and contamination from biotic or abiotic agents such as fungus, glue, or insecticides. Among these, the drying protocol might be particularly influential: specimens not dried efficiently—especially in warm, humid conditions—are prone to rot and degradation, which significantly affects spectral quality. Over time, temperature and humidity fluctuations may accelerate tissue degradation.\nAs a result, herbarium specimens exhibit a wide range of tissue conditions, reflecting both the biology of the living organism and the varied preservation environments they experience. Documenting these sources of variation as metadata is essential, as they can be correlated with model accuracy (Kühn et al. 2024, White et al. 2025) and can be leveraged to improve the performance of predictive models.\nWhen available, contextual details from specimen labels—such as the use of ethanol or other treatments—should be captured in metadata. As it is rare to see such details, botanists should be encouraged to include preservation protocols on specimen labels.\nThe metadata fields hasGlue, hasNonGlueContamination, measurementFlags, and tissueNotes (Table 4.3), are designed to record the condition of the tissue within the target measurement area at the time of measurement. These fields are essential for downstream filtering and analysis of spectra.\nExamples of specimen tissue metadata records are provided in Appendix II.\n\n\n\n6.2 General Guidelines for Tissue Selection\nNote: Much of this text is tailored to measuring leaf tissues, but can generally be applied to other tissues.\n\nQuality over quantity.\n\nUnder the goal of broad digitization of herbarium tissues, spectral data quality could be considered more important than specimen quantity. Targeting higher quality, less degraded specimens will yield more informative spectral data.\n\nIf the majority of tissues on a specimen are degraded, damaged, or contaminated, that specimen should generally not be measured unless it holds particular research value.\n\nSelect specimens based on their general tissue condition:\n\nFor digitization projects focused on broad taxonomic coverage, specimens should be evaluated as whole units when determining suitability for spectral measurement. Next, technicians should prioritize tissues that are both suitable for measurement and representative of the overall condition of the specimen, rather than selecting isolated tissues that are in unusually good condition. This approach helps ensure alignment between the general specimen condition and the resulting spectral data, and could avoid biases based on assumptions of exceptional tissue conditions. If the majority of tissues on a specimen are degraded, damaged, or contaminated, that specimen should generally not be measured unless it holds particular research value. Conversely, if the specimen consists mostly of clean, mature, fully expanded tissues, it is appropriate to proceed with measurement—while also considering additional measurements, when feasible, to capture variation such as developmental stage or damage from herbivory and scoring the appropriate metadata for these additional measurements.\n\nCaveat: while the overall condition of the specimen informs whether it should be measured, metadata on developmental stage, contamination, and tissue condition should always record the characteristics of the specific measurement area of the tissue—not the specimen as a whole. This ensures metadata accuracy and supports high-resolution filtering and analysis. Information about the specimen can be recorded in the tissueNotes field (Table 4.3).\n\nScore metadata with care.\n\nMetadata collection is a critical component for understanding factors affecting spectral data quality and will provide confidence during data aggregation.\n\nHerbaria and research teams should train technicians in specimen selection strategies and scoring metadata to reduce subjectivity.\n\nPrioritize:\n\nTissue measurements on black backgrounds.\n\nDetached tissues of appropriate size in fragment packets allow full assessment of the presence of glue and access to both leaf surfaces.\n\nFor mounted specimens, taped or sewn tissues can have black backing inserted beneath (technicians should look for evidence of old glue).\n\n\nSpecimens with mature tissues (e.g., fully expanded leaves) that are clean of biotic or abiotic contaminants.\n\nTissues that fill the probe measurement area, even if midvein is measured.\n\nLeaves with flat, complete surfaces and intact laminae.\n\nAvoid:\n\nTissues with glue.\n\nTissues attached to herbarium paper such that no black background can be inserted beneath the tissue.\n\nTissues that are not pressed flat (e.g., deformed, folded, crumpled, or abnormal leaves).\n\nTissues contaminated by biotic or abiotic agents (e.g., algae, lichen, fungus, chemical preservatives, glue).\n\nDamaged tissues (e.g., by herbivory, pathogens, herborization phenomena).\n\nMidribs and major venation in the leaves, or other types of vasculature or intrusions in target tissue.\n\nIf larger tissues are available, avoid smaller tissues that don’t cover the entire optical probe measurement area.\n\nMeasuring small tissues:\nMeasuring taxa with naturally small tissues presents unique challenges, but several strategies can help obtain representative spectral measurements with minimal error.\n\nCenter the probe on multiple areas of the small tissue and collect several measurements, then average the values to represent the tissue’s spectral profile.\n\nCreate a mosaic by arranging multiple small tissue units side by side to fill the measurement area. Avoid overlapping tissues, as stacking can alter light scattering and distort reflectance values (Fig. A1).\n\nConsider optical setup with small measurement area: For projects in the instrument selection phase, Spectral Evolution offers a custom optical probe with a 2-mm measurement area compatible with their NaturaSpec and PSR spectroradiometers.\n\nAvoid using narrow angle lenses as these might distort the spectrum (Fig. A1).\n\nMultiple individual plants within one herbarium sheet:\n\nEach individual plant on a sheet should be demarcated with a unique specimenId (see Table 3.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Decision tree for tissue selection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1: Fig. 6.1.

    "text": "5.1 Precautions\n\nCarefully handle backgrounds and white references (e.g., Spectralon®):\n\nUse laboratory gloves to handle black backgrounds and white references and tweezers to handle herbarium tissues.\n\nAvoid touching and dirtying the reflective surfaces.\n\nAvoid blowing or cleaning backgrounds and reference standards with canned air, which can cause chemical contamination (other options, such as O2 Hurricane, avoid this contamination).\n\nAvoid burning target tissues:\n\nHigh light intensities in optical probes can burn tissues, especially thin leaves! Use low light intensity and minimum measurement duration based on manufacturer’s guidance to avoid this.\n\nAvoid measuring tissues with glue on them, whenever possible.\n\nPlace a black background under the leaf or target tissue to avoid spectral contamination from the herbarium mounting paper whenever possible. Background surfaces, except for non-reflective black, will influence reflectance spectra (see Fig. 1.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Spectra Data Files\n\nOutput unprocessed percent reflectance data to files, if possible.\n\nPercent reflectance should be present in the file at the wavelengths directly measured by the instrument.\n\nIf instruments and software output transformed data by default (e.g., Spectral Evolution PSR+ output is interpolated at 1 nm resolution), refer to user manuals to change settings to output percent reflectance values at measured wavelengths instead.\n\nFile formats differ among spectroradiometer manufacturers, models, and softwares.\n\nMake sure that files include percent reflectance values.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Instrumentation and Materials Quality Control\n\nInstrument maintenance:\n\nFollow manufacturer SOP for spectroradiometer maintenance. If possible, send the instrument to the manufacturer at regular intervals for maintenance (e.g., every two years).\n\nHave fiber optic cables checked by the manufacturer annually and replace damaged fiber optic cables.\n\nFor background and white reference measurement requirements, see Section 1.2.\n\nWhite reference scans are typically not saved as a separate file, but the white reference digital numbers (raw sensor values) should be included in each target spectrum file (e.g., .sig format). These values are used by the instrument software to calculate reflectance from raw radiance.\n\nBlack background materials are required to have less than 4% reflectance across all wavelengths (see Fig. 1.1; e.g., IR Flock Sheet from Musou Black USA).\n\nIf measuring leaves on herbarium paper on a benchtop, place a black mat under the herbarium sheets to prevent contaminating reflectance from the benchtop (see Fig. 4.2). Black felt (3–5 mm thick) is a practical and cost-effective choice for this purpose.\n\nTarget measurements of background material (black or paper) must be linked to tissue measurements using filename conventions (Part 3).\n\nThis supports quality control of background conditions and enables development of spectral unmixing approaches to isolate tissue reflectance.\n\nWear gloves and carefully handle all tissues, white reference, black backgrounds, and calibrated reflectance standards to keep them clean (see 5.1 Precautions).\nCalibrated reflectance standards:\n\nInstitutions should consider purchasing calibrated reflectance standards, such as Spectralon® Calibrated (SL Standard) Diffuse Reflectance Standards. These should be kept clean and separate from ‘working’ white references, and used for long-term assessment of instrument performance, optical drift, and the condition of reference materials (e.g., white references and black backgrounds).\n\nThese are supplied with a calibration certificate and serial number that verifies reflectance values across wavelengths.\n\nReflectance standards are white (e.g., Spectralon® 99%) and black (e.g., Spectralon® 2%) at a minimum, and can also include gradations of gray.\n\nIt is recommended that standards be measured at regular intervals depending on the level of activity (e.g., once per session; consult spectroradiometer manufacturer), and archived with the filename conventions provided in Table 3.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Specimen and Tissue Annotation\n\nMetadata recommendation:\n\nIHerbSpec recommends recording the tissueLocation metadata field (see Table 4.3) to document the position of measured tissues on the specimen.\n\nConsult with herbarium collections managers to define a suitable specimen annotation protocol that aligns with institutional policies.\nRecommended specimen annotation practices:\n\nAttach a project annotation label to the herbarium sheet (e.g., “Leaf spectral reflectance; DM White (2025)”).\n\nUse archival-quality materials for labels and annotations, such as acid-free paper.\n\nUse pencil for direct annotation of measured tissues on sheets.\n\nFor loose tissues (from packets or envelopes):\n\nPlace the measured tissue in a glassine envelope, which is archival and thin.\n\nInclude a label inside the envelope indicating the targetTissueClass and targetTissueId (see Table 4.3; e.g., “Tissue TN1”).\n\nStore the envelope in the specimen packet or attach it to the herbarium sheet (see Fig. 4.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the protocol\n\nProceed to Part 6\n\nBrowse additional parts and appendices:\n\nPart 1 – Overview\n\nPart 2 – Measurement and Metadata Workflow\n\nPart 3 – Filename Conventions and Formats\n\nPart 4 – Metadata and Databasing\n\nPart 5 – Instrumentation and Materials Guidelines\n\nPart 6 – Selecting Tissues for Spectral Measurement\n\nReferences\nAppendix I – Number of Measurements per Tissue\n\nAppendix II – Tissue Metadata for Quality Control"

    "text": "This appendix provides a brief discussion and examples of the IHerbSpec approach for recording metadata pertaining to sources of biological and herborization variation that affect spectral data. As explained in Section 6.1 Sources of Variation, we aim to capture biological variation that is scientifically meaningful, but the degraded nature of herbarium specimens requires a careful assessment and annotation of tissue quality and sources of contamination. The Tissue Metadata fields of developmentalStage, hasGlue, hasNonGlueContamination, measurementFlags, and tissueNotes Table 4.3 are designed to support quality control of spectral data and enable downstream filtering.\nThe codes for enumerating the developmentalStage fields are provided in Table 4.4, and the codes for measurementFlags are described in Table 4.6.\nTechnicians should also be aware that some taxa (e.g. Myrtaceae) or tropical collections in general may naturally exhibit discoloration or non-flat, deformed surfaces (e.g., Gasteranthus atratus). Such characteristics do not necessarily indicate tissue degradation and poor-quality spectral data. In addition, some taxa exhibit more pronounced discoloration during herborization as a result of their biology, and such discoloration should not be interpreted as evidence of poor preservation condition. Some traits also covary; for example, young leaves wilt and become discolored faster and are more challenging to press and dry flat, so they may more often be scored as moderately or poorly preserved.\nAs a reminder, measurementFlags pertain only to the measurement area, not the whole tissue unit (e.g., leaf). Since suitable measurement areas of tissues (see decision tree in Fig. 6.1) will not contain any contaminants, pathogens, or other damage, technicians should not be enumerating any codes in the measurementFlags field. This could differ in projects collecting measurements pertaining to extended uses of the specimen, e.g., symbionts, degradation, etc., that might be measuring tissue areas with these other features.\nThe specimens and metadata examples in Table A1 have been selected to guide consistent scoring of these fields during spectral measurement and promote metadata consistency across projects. Note that the images do not specify the exact measurement area corresponding to these metadata fields (as is done in the IHerbSpec Metadata Spreadsheet for specimen NEBC_00651639 shown in main text Fig. 2.2).\n\nTable A1: Select Metadata Fields and Scoring for Representative Specimens.\nThis table provides example metadata records for herbarium specimens, illustrating how to score key fields related to tissue condition and contamination. The fields developmentalStage, hasGlue, hasNonGlueContamination, and measurementFlags refer specifically to the measurement area. Broader observations about the specimen or other tissues can be recorded in tissueNotes (see Table 4.3). Linked specimen images are included, though they do not indicate the precise measurement area corresponding to each metadata record.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Spectral measurements of plant tissues are highly sensitive to both instrument configuration and small spatial differences across target tissue. Changes in the optical probe geometry in relation to the tissue—such as tilting, poor contact with the leaf surface, partial coverage of the measurement area (Fig. A1), or micro-contaminants like debris—can introduce technical errors. In addition, leaf surface microtopography, anatomical variation, and alterations from herborization (e.g., drying distortion, discoloration, or degradation) all contribute to variation in reflectance spectra (Cavender-Bares et al. 2025).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1: Fig. A1: Variability in spectral measurements due to instrument configuration and technical error. The following spectral measurements are shown: white calibration standard (red), black background (orange), standard adaxial measurement with black background (light green), standard adaxial measurement but with narrow-angle lens following recalibration (dark green), adaxial measurement where the tissue did not fully cover the optical field of view (i.e., backgroundInMeasurement = TRUE; blue), and a folded leaf (purple). All measurements were made of the same tissue using an SVC HR-1024i spectroradiometer.\n\n\n\nThese considerations support the IHerbSpec Protocol requirement of collecting a minimum of three representative measurements per adaxial and abaxial leaf surface, when suitable tissues for both surfaces are available. Three measurements are necessary to calculate a mean spectrum and its variance. The protocol further recommends collecting five measurements per surface to achieve a more robust spectral characterization and to meet the threshold for improved performance in classification models. The protocol allows for users to make these minimum or higher measurements across one or many leaves. For other tissue types, at least three measurements are recommended, with more encouraged when feasible. Below, we elaborate justification for this recommendation.\nSeveral studies have demonstrated improved model performance when multiple measurements per individual specimen are averaged, including those by Durgante et al. (2013; Figs. A2, A3), Neto-Bradley et al. (2025), and S. Bazan et al. (Unpubl.). The IHerbSpec Protocol’s recommendation of five measurements is based on empirical evidence that model accuracy gains tend to stabilize beyond five to ten measurements per tissue (Fig. A2), although the optimal number may vary depending on tissue type, instrument sensitivity, and modeling goals. Beyond classification, IHerbSpec members are investigating how replicate measurements affect the accuracy and robustness of trait prediction models, evaluating both the benefits of averaging spectra and the variation in predicted trait values from unaveraged measurements of the same tissue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2: Fig. A2: Accuracy of taxonomic discrimination as a function of the number of averaged measurements per specimen. Three tissue class datasets are analyzed: combined adaxial and abaxial spectra (circles), abaxial only (squares), and adaxial only (triangles). Each point represents the average classification accuracy from 50 replicate linear discriminant analysis models, using randomized subsampling and test set validation. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The vertical gray line marks the minimum number of spectral measurements (n = 5), below which accuracy significantly decreases (Tukey test, P ≤ 0.05). Data were collected using an FT-NIR spectrometer (1000–2500 nm) from 10 species in Lecythidaceae, including eight Eschweilera and two Corythophora species. Accuracy increases notably between one and five spectra per specimen, after which performance stabilizes, indicating diminishing returns beyond five measurements. This figure is reproduced from Durgante et al. (2013) with permission from the publisher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3: Fig. A3: Spectral variability as a function of the number of measurements averaged per measurement. Here, a total of 100 spectral measurements were collected from a single Annona sp. leaf using an ASD LabSpec Pro spectrometer over a black background. Subsets of these measurements were then averaged in groups ranging from 2 to 40 to simulate different measurement strategies. The plot shows the root mean square (RMS) distance between replicate spectra as a function of the number of measurements averaged, illustrating that spectral variability decreases substantially as more measurements are combined. Notably, averaging fewer than five measurements did not adequately capture intra-tissue spectral variation. This analysis supported the required minimum of 10 measurements per specimen for the formal protocol currently implemented by teams at CIRAD and IRD in France (Mersni et al. 2025).\n\n\n\nAnother important recommendation in the IHerbSpec Protocol is to measure both adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces. These surfaces differ in anatomy and function due to evolutionary adaptations for light capture, gas exchange, and environmental stress. Such structural differences are consistently reflected in their spectral signatures (see Fig. 1.1), and we recommend measuring both surfaces—when suitable tissue is accessible—to capture this biologically meaningful variation.\nWithin the context of a large-scale macroevolutionary project focusing on Annonaceae (ERC GLOBAL project), researchers aimed to measure spectra on one specimen per species with the intent to capture as much variation as possible for each specimen. In accordance with the protocol established at the Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement (CIRAD), researchers decided to make 20 spectral measurements per specimen to develop their spectral library for 1700 Annonaceae species preserved in over 30 different herbaria.\nThis decision was informed by preliminary experiments demonstrating that spectral stability improves with larger numbers of measurements (Fig. A3). The choice of 20 spectra was also appropriate because of variation in the number and size of leaves, allowing for multiple measurements of multiple leaves or single large leaves that filled an entire herbarium sheet. It also allowed for poor-quality spectra to be discarded based on downstream filtering criteria while still retaining a large number of measurements per specimen.\nOverall, given the sensitivity of spectral data, research projects are encouraged—when feasible—to collect more than five measurements per tissue, including across different tissue units within an individual. This enables further assessment of intra-individual spectral heterogeneity and its impact on downstream analyses.\nThe marginal cost of additional measurements is relatively low across instruments, with a single measurement typically completed within 1 to 10 seconds. Nevertheless, determining the appropriate number of measurements remains a critical design consideration, particularly in large-scale digitization projects involving significant resource investment.\n\n\nNavigate the protocol\nBrowse additional parts and appendices below\n\nPart 1 – Overview\n\nPart 2 – Measurement and Metadata Workflow\n\nPart 3 – Filename Conventions and Formats\n\nPart 4 – Metadata and Databasing\n\nPart 5 – Instrumentation and Materials Guidelines\n\nPart 6 – Selecting Tissues for Spectral Measurement\n\nReferences\nAppendix I – Number of Measurements per Tissue\n\nAppendix II – Tissue Metadata for Quality Control"

These are recommended filename standards designed for reliable parsing regardless of segment order, corresponding to required metadata fields described in Part 4. The spectrometer software will automatically append a measurement index (IDX) to the end of each filename—no additional text should be added after the IDX.\nFilename formats differ slightly depending on the type of target material (i.e., targetClass; see Table 4.5). For white and black-background targets, the projectId (PI) and sessionId (SI) are key segments for traceability and the SI is also critical for linking to all associated tissue measurements via the tissue full filename. For tissues, the full filename convention also includes the minimum session-level, specimen-level, and tissue-level metadata needed for confident data aggregation.\nA simplified filename convention may be used during measurement sessions to streamline data collection. However, projects should convert all filenames to the full format before archiving or sharing. When using the simplified format for local files, projects should maintain consistent file organization and take precautions to prevent ambiguity."

However, the spectra in the near-infrared (700–1,100 nm) and shortwave infrared (1,100–2,500 nm) regions are instead clustered by the background material, revealing both biological and background contamination effects on reflectance spectra.

    "text": "Abstract\nReflectance spectroscopy is a powerful, broadly integrative tool for capturing plant phenotypes. But variation in instrumentation and measurement procedures introduces a high risk of data incompatibility and signal contamination. These challenges are amplified in herbarium specimens because they are subject to complex variation from age, preservation techniques, and mounting practices.\nTo support global data harmonization and scientific reproducibility, this document presents a standardized, interoperable protocol for the spectral measurement of herbarium tissues. It provides data-driven justification and community-informed guidance for measurement procedures and metadata fields, with the goal of improving data quality and enabling confident data aggregation across institutions.\n\n\n\nIHerbSpec and Protocol Development\nThe International Herbarium Spectral Digitization (IHerbSpec) Working Group was established in December 2024 as a global consortium focused on advancing the use of reflectance spectroscopy of herbarium specimens for ecological and evolutionary studies.\nThe group actively collaborates to identify common challenges, facilitate collaborations, and develop best practices.\nThis protocol is the outcome of IHerbSpec’s initial collaborative phase. From December 2024 to June 2025, members convened virtually to share project-specific workflows and align measurement strategies. The effort culminated in an in-person workshop at the Harvard University Herbaria (May 1–3, 2025), where members reached consensus on key elements of the protocol, including:\n\nThe minimum and recommended number of measurements for leaf tissues (see Section 1.2: Strategy and number of tissue measurements).\n\nTissue condition and contamination metadata (see Section 1.2: Scoring metadata pertaining to tissue condition and contamination).\n\nTissue development stage metadata (see Table 4.4).\n\nIHerbSpec will continue to refine and expand this protocol and welcomes inquiries from interested researchers or institutions wishing to ask questions, provide feedback, or explore opportunities for participation.\n\n\n\nAuthors\n\nDawson M.

    "text": "This section defines the metadata fields used to describe spectral reflectance measurements of herbarium specimens. This standardization supports interoperability, cross-project data aggregation, and future integration into biodiversity informatics platforms.\nProjects can download the IHerbSpec Metadata Spreadsheet (available at https://iherbspec.github.io/protocol) as a foundation for organizing their metadata. This spreadsheet includes all required and optional but recommended fields defined the tables in Section 4.1. The controlled vocabularies necessary for enumerating certain fields are provided in Section 4.2. Finally, Section 4.3 provides general guidelines for data and metadata storage and dissemination.\nWhile metadata are expected to be disseminated in a flat file format, such as the IHerbSpec Metadata Spreadsheet, fields are presented here in logical groups—project, specimen, and tissue—to support conceptual understanding and integration with local databases.\n\n\n4.1 Metadata Tables\n\nTable 4.1: Session Metadata\nSession metadata are those metadata usually associated globally with a continuous digitization project.

Tissues that are simply discolored may still be considered well preserved if other aspects of integrity are maintained.\n\n\nMediumPreservation\nTissue in the measurement area shows moderate degradation, such as partial discoloration, wilting, or deformation. Some structural loss may be present, though not severe. Evidence of degradation from other parts of the specimen (e.g., mold elsewhere on the tissue) may support assigning this level of preservation, but such observations should be recorded in tissueNotes if not present within the measurement area. This is expected to be the most common preservation condition for herbarium specimens used in spectral measurement.\n\n\nPoorPreservation\nTissue in the measurement area shows clear signs of degradation, including severe discoloration, wrinkling, deformation, or breakage. Mold, insect damage, or other signs of poor preservation may also be present. As with other flags, evidence of degradation outside the measurement area (e.g., mold elsewhere on the tissue) may support the assigned flag but should be recorded in tissueNotes if not directly observed in the measurement area. Note that natural discoloration tendencies of certain taxa should be considered when applying this flag (see Appendix II).\n\n\nMidveinPresent\nTarget measurement area contains midvein or similarly prominent secondary venation.\n\n\nOrganismPresent\nIndicates that a visible organism (e.g., bryophyte, lichen, fungal structure) is present on or within the measurement area. This includes epiphyllous, endophytic, or other leaf-associated organisms, regardless of their ecological role (e.g., mutualistic, parasitic, or incidental). This flag serves as a general indicator and can be used in conjunction with more specific organism flags below.\n\n\nBryophytePresent\nIndicates that a visible bryophyte (e.g., moss, liverwort, or hornwort) is present on or within the measurement area.\n\n\nLichenPresent\nIndicates that a visible lichen thallus or fragment is present on or within the measurement area.\n\n\nFungusPresent\nIndicates that fungal structures are visible in the measurement area (e.g., hyphae, mycelium, fruiting body) and are presumed to be pre-mortem associates, such as endophytes or pathogens active while the plant was alive. This flag can overlap with PathogenPresent or MoldPresent.\n\n\nPathogenPresent\nTarget measurement area contains necrotic tissue or other signs of pathogenic infection. Can be used with FungusPresent when fungal pathogens are suspected or known. This flag is based on visible tissue symptoms, not molecular confirmation.\n\n\nMoldPresent\nIndicates that the measurement area shows signs of post-mortem fungal growth (e.g., surface mold, fuzz, bloom), likely resulting from poor drying or storage conditions. In practice, mold may be difficult to distinguish from other fungal growth without microscopic or culture analysis.

This ensures that the data remain co-located with the physical specimen and integrated with institutional capabilities for managing specimen metadata.\nIn addition, projects should upload unprocessed, original format data files and metadata to a persistent, open-access repository that issues DOIs and supports versioning, such as Dryad, Zenodo, or Harvard Dataverse. These platforms are preferred over tools like EcoSIS, which have shown reduced reliability and uncertain long-term support.\nTo facilitate reuse, users may also choose to also share tabular data files (e.g., .csv) with samples in rows and columns for metadata fields and spectral band values. If processed spectra are included (e.g., interpolated, splice/jump-corrected, or continuum- removed), the applied processing steps should be clearly documented.\nSee example of data and metadata sharing here: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LXPHBC\n\n\n\n\nNavigate the protocol\n\nProceed to Part 5\n\nBrowse additional parts and appendices:\n\nPart 1 – Overview\n\nPart 2 – Measurement and Metadata Workflow\n\nPart 3 – Filename Conventions and Formats\n\nPart 4 – Metadata and Databasing\n\nPart 5 – Instrumentation and Materials Guidelines\n\nPart 6 – Selecting Tissues for Spectral Measurement\n\nReferences\nAppendix I – Number of Measurements per Tissue\n\nAppendix II – Tissue Metadata for Quality Control"
